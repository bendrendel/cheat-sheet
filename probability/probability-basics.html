    <h1>Probability Basics</h1>

    <h2>Set Theory</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Set</strong> Sets are a collection of elements where each element is unique, and order doesn't matter. Represented by curly braces and often denoted by a capital letter e.g. A = {Book, Folder, Pen, Paper, Hat}</li>
        <li><strong>Subset</strong> One set is a subset of another if each element of the set is contained in the other. e.g. A is a subset of B if A = {1, 3, 2} and B = {4, 2, 1, 5, 3}</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Basic Terms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Experiment/Trial</strong> An Experiment is something that produces observations with some degree of uncertainty. A single run of an experiment is a Trial.</li>
        <li><strong>Sample Point/Sample Space</strong> A Sample Point is a single possible outcome of an experiment, and the Sample Space of an experiment is the set of all possible sample points of the experiment.</li>
        <li><strong>Event</strong> An event is a specific outcome or set of outcomes and is a subset of the Sample Space.</li>
        <li><strong>Probability</strong> If we run an experiment an infinite number of times, the probability of a given event is the proportion of times it occurs.  This is known as the frequentist interpretation of probability.  This is denoted mathematically as P(Event) = (Number of times event occurred)/(Number of Trials).</li>
        <li><strong>Law of Large Numbers</strong> You can't perform an infinite number of trials of an experiment, but the law of large numbers is that as you perform more and more trials, the probability of any given event will converge to its true probability.</li>
        <li>For example, say the experiment is flipping a coin twice and the observation is which side of the coin lands up on each flip.
        <ul>
            <li>There are four possible sample points for this experiment depending on the side of the first flip and the side of the second flip.  The full sample space could be represented as S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}</li>
            <li>Possible events you might be interested in are getting two heads, A = {HH}, getting two tails, B = {TT}, or getting a heads and a tails, C = {HT, TH}</li>
            <li>You might run 1000 trials of the experiment, and notice that {HH} occurred 252 times. Thus you could estimate the probability of getting two heads with two coin flips is P({HH}) = 252/1000 = .252 = 25.2%</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
