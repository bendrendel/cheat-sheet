        <h2>Color Theory</h2>
        <p>Primary colors: Red, Blue, Yellow</p>
        <p>Secondary colors created by mixing primary colors: Green, Orange, Purple</p>
        <p>Warm colors: Reds, oranges, yellows, browns, tans, evoke warmth, aggression, boldness</p>
        <p>Cool colors: Blues, purples, greens, most grays, evoke calmness, soothing, winter, water</p>
        <p>Neutral colors: Colors with low lightness and/or saturation</p>
        <p>Tint/Shade: Tint means increasing the lightness of a given hue, shade means decreasing the 
            lightness of a given hue</p>
        <p>Contrast: hue is most contrasting on opposite side of color wheel, lightness contrast is 
            highest with 100% difference</p>

        <p>Monochromatic: Uses shades and tints of a single hue, evokes organized, harmonic feeling</p>
        <p>Complementary: Uses two hues 180deg apart, common for logos, dramatic display of color, 
            can clash if large areas of the two hues are adjacent</p>
        <p>Analogous: Uses multiple hues close to each other, often one dominate hue, a second support 
            hue, and third accent hue, pleasing, calming, low-contrast, good for backgrounds, not good to 
            draw attention</p>
        <p>Triadic: Uses three hues 120deg apart, evoke equality, vibrancy, security</p>

        <h2>Best Practices</h2>
        <p>Neon colors: Use sparingly as they can be hard on the eyes</p>
        <p>Vibrating effect: Created by adjacent colors with complementary hues and high saturation, avoid</p>
        <p>Use Contrast Selectively: Limit overall contrast on page and use it selectively to highlight 
            important things like actions the user should take</p>
        <p>Foreground/Background Contrast: <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">Contract Checker</a> 
            ensure text or foreground content is sufficiently contrasting with background,
            but extreme conftrast can also be hard to read like pure black on white. WCAG recommends
            text is 4.5 times lighter or darker in luminance than the background, unless font size is at least
            24 pixels then can be 3 times lighter or darker.</p>
        <p>Background colors: Neutral allows you to easily add high contrast where needed, dark for light 
            text or assets, medium difficult to create enough contrast with text or foreground content</p>    
        <p>Brand colors: Good brands have a brand color, and this should take up 60% of the color on the site</p>
        <p>Accent colors: Use to draw the users attention, such as in calls-to-action</p>
        <p>Buttons: Good to use accent color for buttons, should have different states like hover, disabled; hover 
            typically a shade or tint of button color</p>
        <p>Input field: Should have states like selected and disabled, can have success and failure, selected 
            typically uses a border color or box shadow effect</p>
        <p>Semantic Colors: Red for errors, etc. see below </p>
        <p>Whitespace: empty areas between elements, be sure to use it to help focus content, but not so much to 
            cause issues trying to navigate seamlessly through content</p>
        <p>Color blindness: <a href="http://colorsafe.co/">Accessible Color Palettes</a> some users cannot distinguish 
            red-green well, also blue-yellow where blues appear green, and total color blindness,
            pair color indicators with symbols to help, like an x symbol with a red error message</p>
        <p>Err on the side of usability over aesthetics if they are in conflict</p>

        <h2>Color Associations</h2>
        <p>Red: Passionate, energetic, angry / user error messages and delete buttons</p>
        <p>Orange: Optimistic, playful, fun</p>
        <p>Yellow: Welcoming, intellectual, impatient / warning messages or errors in the code</p>
        <p>Green: Prosperous, balanced, growing / success, enticement to submit or go forward</p>
        <p>Blue: Peaceful, loyal, cold</p>
        <p>Purple: Imaginative, royal, spiritual</p>
        <p>Gray: Unemotional, compromising</p>
        <p>White: Innocent, pure</p>
        <p>Black: Luxurious, powerful</p>

        <h2>Setting color with CSS</h2>
        <p>Foreground color set with color property, background color set with background-color property</p>
        <p>Opacity or Alpha can be set with opacity property or in hsla or rgba between 0 (transparent) and 1 
            (opaque), amount of background to blend with each pixel</p>
        <p id="ex-keyword">Color keywords provide limited options, 147 colors, including transparent which is 
            equivalent to rgba(0,0,0,0)</p>
        <p id="ex-rgb">rgb or rgba takes three values defining intensity of red, green, blue, each between 
            0-255, or 0-100%, 256*256*256=16,777,216 colors; rgba takes fourth value for alph from 0 to 1</p>
        <p id="ex-hex">Hex is exactly the same color spectrum as rgb but defined with three consecutive hexadecimal 
            numbers (16 digit number system 0-9 A-F) for hexadecimal numbers that repeat two characters, you can 
            represent them with one</p>
        <p id="ex-hsla">hsl or hsla is most intuitive and semantic, hue is 0-360 (degrees), saturation 0%-100%, 
            lightness is 0%-100%, alpha (for HSLA only) is 0 to 1</p>
