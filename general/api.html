        <h1>APIs</h1>

        <h2>Basics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>API</strong> stands for Application Programming Interface</li>
            <li>Used in programming languages to abstract away details and provide easier to use access to functionality</li>
            <li>Provides specific rules to outside applications for how to interact with the data,
                like how to retrieve data that the outside application can then use</li>
            <li>Client-side javascript APIs fall into two categories</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Browser APIs are APIs built into web browser that provide access to functionality written in lower level languages like C or Rust. Generally provide functionality through an
                    object made available in the browser environment.  
                </li>
                <li>Third-Party APIs are APIs not built into the web browser.  On the web, often a layer of software on a server that handles operations on a database.  Often data is returned as a JSON object, which you can manipulate to use in your application</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Library/Framework APIs: These are third-party apis that are imported by linking the src url in your html file using a script tag with the src set to the third party api url.  Then you can use objects in the linked code.  There may be css to link to as well using a link tag with the href set to the third-party api's css.
                        </li>
                        <li>RESTful APIs: These require you to make an HTTP request to a server to retrieve data.  Oten you send URL parameters to the API's URL, and it sends back data based on that.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Browser APIs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Manipulating documents, like the DOM API</li>
            <li>Fetching data from a server, like XMLHttpRequest, and Fetch</li>
            <li>Drawing and manipulating graphics, like Canvas and WebGL</li>
            <li>Audio and Video, like HTMLMediaElement, Web Audio, and WebRTC</li>
            <li>Devices, like notifications API, or vibration API</li>
            <li>Client-side storage, like Web Storage, and IndexedDB</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party APIs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Free APIs: </strong>Some APIs like Yelp offer their API to the public to expand their reach because they make money
                the more their data gets viewed
            </li>
            <li><strong>Paid APIs: </strong>Paid APIs like twilio offer valuable services to programmers for a monthly fee or per use fee</li>
            <li><strong>Internal APIs: </strong>Developers will use APIs in their apps to allow for easy expansion, so different versions
                of their software (web, mobile, etc.) can easily use the API to interact with the data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>API Documentation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>APIs will provide documentation of how to utilize the API</li>
            <li><strong>API Key</strong> this is often require to be registered with a third-party API
            to use it, it should be kept secret because malicious users could use it to rack up charges on paid APIs</li>
        </ul>
