    <h2>Basic matching</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/e/</code> matches the first instance of the letter e</li>
        <li><code>/e/g</code> g global flag, matches all instances of the letter e</li>
        <li><code>/e/gi</code> adding the i case insensitive flag, matches all instances of e or E</li>
        <li><code>/\d/g</code> matches any digit character 0-9</li>
        <li><code>/e+/g</code> matches all instances of one or more e's in a row</li>
        <li><code>/ea?/g</code> matches all instances of e and if an a comes after the e, will match 
            the ea, ? is like optional</li>
        <li><code>/ea*/g</code> matches all instances of e and if one or more a's come after the e,
            will match those too. ea+ would require there to be at least one a for a match, whereas ea*
            makes the a optional</li>
        <li><code>/.e/g</code> matches all instances of e and whatever character appears before the e,
            except will not match the new line character if that is what appears before the e. period
            matches any single character</li>
        <li><code>/\./g</code> matches all instances of a period, using escape character \ so that the
            period is treated literally</li>
        <li><code>/\w/g</code> matches all word characters, essentially matches all words in a sentence
            and not spaces or punctuation. also matches numbers and underscore.</li>
        <li><code>/\W/g</code> matches the opposite of what \w matches</li>
        <li><code>/\s/g</code> matches all tabs and spaces and line breaks</li>
        <li><code>/\S/g</code> matches the opposite of what \s matches</li>
        <li><code>/^The/g</code> matches The, but only if it is at the very beginning of the string.</li>
        <li><code>/^The/gm</code> matches The, but only if it is the very beginning of the string or if it
            is immediately preceded by a new line character (m flag is for multiline)</li>
        <li><code>/\.$/</code> matches a period but only if it occurs at the very end of the string.</li>
        <li><code>/\.$/</code> matches a period if it occurs at the very end of the string, or it is
            immediately followed by a new line character</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Counting characters</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/\w{4}/g</code> matches word characters where there are 4 in a row. if there is a word
            that is 10 word characters long, then it will match the first 4, and then match the second 4,
            but won't match the last 2.</li>
        <li><code>/\w{4,}/g</code> matches word characters where there are 4 or more in a row.  if there is
            a word that is 10 word characters long, then it will match all 10 characters</li>
        <li><code>/\w{4,5}/g</code> matches word characters where there are at least 4 in a row and up to 
            5 in a row.  if there is a word that is 10 word characters long, then it will match the first 5,
            and then match the second 5.</li>
        <li><code>/re{2,3}/g</code> matches any r that has at least 2 e's after it, and matches up to 3 e's
            after it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grouping</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/[fc]at/g</code> matches all instances of at that are preceded by an f or c, and
            includes the f or c in the match</li>
        <li><code>/[c-f]at/g</code> matches all instances of at that are preceded by a c, d, e, or f, 
            including the c, d, e, or f in the match.</li>
        <li><code>/[a-zA-z]at/g</code> matches all instances of at that are preceded by an uppercase
            or lowercase letter.</li>
        <li><code>/[ ]at/g</code> matches all instances of at preceded by a space</li>
        <li><code>/(t|T)he/g</code> match all instances of he preceded by either t or T. equivalent to
            /[tT]he/g</li>
        <li><code>/(r|e|t){2-3}/g</code> match all instances where 2 to 3 r's, e's, or t's appear in a row,
            in any order or combination. e.g. the word 'street' will be matched with 'tre' getting a match and then 'et' getting a match.</li>
        <li><code>/(r|e|t){2-3}\./g</code> match all instances where 2 to 3 r's, e's, or t's appear in a row,
            and are followed by a period.  e.g. the word 'street.' (at the end of sentence) will match the
            'eet.'</li>
        <li><code>/(re){2-3}/g</code> matches all instances of 're' repeated 2 to 3 times. e.g. 're' will
            not match and 'rererere' will match the first 3 repeats of 're', or 'rerere'</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Look ahead and look behind</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/(?$lt=[tT]he)./g</code> will match any single character preceded by the or The, but does
            not include the or The in the match.  this is look behind. For instance "This is the sentence" will match the space after "the"</li>
        <li><code>/(?$lt![tT]he)./g</code> inverse of above, matches everything except any character that is
            preceded by the or The.  For instance "This is the sentence" will match everything except for 
            the space after "the"</li>
        <li><code>/.(?=at)/g</code> will match any character followed by at, but the at is not included in
            the match  this is look ahead.  e.g. "Fat cats like to eat." will match the F, c, and e.</li>
        <li><code>/.(?!at)/g</code> inverse of above, matching everything except any character followed
            by at</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/\d{10}/g</code> matches a phone number like 1234567890</li>
        <li><code>/\d{3}-?\d{3}-?d{4}/g</code> matches a phone number like 1234567890 or
            123-456-7890</li>
        <li><code>/\d{3}[ -]?\d{3}[ -]?d{4}/g</code> matches a phone number like 1234567890 or
            123-456-7890 or 123 456 7890</li>
        <li><code>/(\d{3})[ -]?(\d{3})[ -]?(d{4})/g</code> matches a phone number like 1234567890 or
            123-456-7890 or 123 456 7890, but now it returns three groups containing the digits only.
            The groups can be accessed with $1, $2, and $3</li>
        <li><code>/(?&ltareacode>\d{3})[ -]?(\d{3})[ -]?(d{4})/g</code> matches a phone number like
            1234567890 or 123-456-7890 or 123 456 7890, but now it returns three groups containing the digits only and the first group is given a name of areacode, so the groups can be accessed with $areacode, $2, and $3.  areacode can also still be accessed with $1</li>
        <li><code>/\(?(?&ltareacode>\d{3})\)?[ -]?(\d{3})[ -]?(d{4})/g</code> matches a phone number like
            1234567890 or 123-456-7890 or 123 456 7890 or (123)4567890 or (123)-456-7890 or (123) 456 7890</li>
        <li><code>/(\+1[ -])?\(?(?&ltareacode>\d{3})\)?[ -]?(\d{3})[ -]?(d{4})/g</code> matches a phone
            number like 1234567890 or 123-456-7890 or 123 456 7890 or (123)4567890 or (123)-456-7890 or (123) 456 7890 but any of them could also have a +1, +1 , or +1- in front</li>        
        <li><code>/(?:(\+1)[ -])?\(?(?&ltareacode>\d{3})\)?[ -]?(\d{3})[ -]?(d{4})/g</code> matches a phone
            number like 1234567890 or 123-456-7890 or 123 456 7890 or (123)4567890 or (123)-456-7890 or (123) 456 7890 but any of them could also have a +1, +1 , or +1- in front.  However, now the +1 has been placed in its own group so that the group doesn't conatin the space or -, and then the group that would contain the space or - has been excluded from being captured by using ?:.  Now this will return four group, where $1 contains +1, $2 contains 123, $3 contains 456 , and $4 contains 7890.</li>
