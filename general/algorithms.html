    <h2>Recursion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A method of problem-solving that defines a problem in terms of itself.  A function definition that invokes itself in the body of the function.</li>
        <li>A recursive function always has two parts, one that runs when the base case condition is statisfied, and on that runs when the recursive case condition is satisfied:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Base Case Check: Checking if the input is simplified enough to take base case action.  There may be multiple conditions that make up the base case: Base Case 1, Base Case 2, etc.  E.g. if searching for something in a list, the base case could be that it is found, or that the end of the list was reached.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Base Case Action: Some action taken, often returning a value. Could be multiple different actions if there are multiple base case conditions, e.g. returning a found value vs returning null if the end of the list is reached.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Recursive Case Check: Checking if recursive case is met, may be done implicitly simply by the fact that none of the base cases were met.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Recursive Case Action: The function is invoked with input that is closer to the base case.  Some action is taken often returning a value, which may depend on getting output from the recursively called function</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Each recusive call adds to the call stack, calling the function with a different execution context that gets closer and closer to the base case.  When the base case is reached, the last function call returns, allowing earlier calls to return one by one.</li>
    </ul>
