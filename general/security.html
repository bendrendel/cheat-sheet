    <h2>Terms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Vulnerability: Sometimes called a security bug, is like other bugs in software, but is
            one that could be used for abuse. Try to be aware of the common ones to reduce them as
            much as you can.  Much of what you can do is just good programming practice like validating
            data entered by user, ensuring a single user can't take up too much time, build unit tests.
        </li>
        <li>Security Features: A first line of defense against abuse of vulnerabilities, includes
            HTTPS and CORS.
        </li>
        <li>Authentication: Process used by applications to confirm identities of users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>CORS</h2>
    <h3>Security Policy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When you visit a website, it comes from one server, but it may direct your browser to
            get assets from many different servers, like images, css files, fonts, etc.  This can pose
            a security risk to the client if e.g the page is hijacked and malicious code is downloaded from
            some server.
        </li>
        <li>Security policies can be implemented on servers to mitigate this risk</li>
        <li>Security policies are based on the origin of assets.  The origin is the combination of 
            the protocol (e.g. http://), the host (e.g. www.example.com/), and the port (e.g. 80 is default)
        </li>
        <li>Same-origin policy only allows a website to use assets from the same origin, for example a link
            on a webpage can only go to another webpage at the same origin, or an image can only come from the same origin. This is safe but can be too restrictive.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>CORS Security Policy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>CORS stands for Cross-origin resource sharing, and is a standard security policy that is less restrictive than same-origin but still provides protection.  CORS manages cross-origin http requests for assets</li>
        <li>CORS allows servers to specify who can access assets on them, and how to access them</li>
        <li>For example, many servers will allow cross origin GET requests from any requestor, but not allow push, pull, or delete requests.  Others may only allow requests from specific requestors.</li>
        <li>CORS is implemented in the backend and all done using request headers. There are a dozen or so CORS request header properties. e.g. Access-Control-Allow-Origin is set to * if all origins are allowed to make requests, or some specific list of domains if only certain origins are.</li>
        <li>Many HTTP methods like PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, will send a preflight request to the server that is sent before the real request is sent.  The server responds to the preflight request saying what methods are allowed from the user, and the user can send the real request if allowed, or cancel it if not. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Authentication</h2>
    <h3>Password Authentication</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Most common kind of authentication is for user to enter email/username and password.</li>
        <li>This is sent to a server that checks the information, and if valid, typically sends 
            back an authentication token (auth token).  The auth token can be used by the client
            to send with additional HTTP requests so the user doesn't have to keep logging in.  The auth
            token usually expires after a certain amount of time.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>API Key</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This kind of authentication is used for applications sending requests to third-party APIs.</li>
        <li>Public APIs will provide a developer portal of some kind, allowing the developer to register
            their application with the API and receive an API key unique to be used for that application.
        </li>
        <li>Allows the API to throttle requests, ensuring no spam or abuse, and ensure correct access permissions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>OAuth</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This is use with APIs that provide access to user data. Generally these APIs don't allow the developer to access user data with just an API Key.  They also need the user to allow it.</li>
        <li>One approach to this problem could be having the user provide their username and password to
            the intermediary application accessing the API.  However, this is insecure since the intermediary
            application now has the user's credentials and now full access to the user's account.
        </li>
        <li>OAuth is a better solution and is an open standard, i.e. guidelines, that many APIs follow in a roughly similar way.</li>
        <li>The generic OAuth flow, is the user is redirected from the intermediary app to a login site for the API provider, like Google.  The API provider has them login and decide what access to allow to 
        the intermediary.  Then the API provider redirects them back to the intermediary with an access token.
        The access token can be used by the intermediary to gain access to the user's data.  The access token may expire after a certain time.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>OAuth2</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A newer version of OAuth to handle different kinds of flows and levels of access</li>
        <li>Client Credentials Grant: This is similar to the API Key authentication, and is only used by the developer, the end user does not participate in the flow.  Instead of an API Key, the API can use a client ID and client secret, granted when the application is registered with the API.  These are exchanged for an access token and sometimes a refresh token.  Access tokens are sent with requests to the API as authorization, and typically expire frequently.  Once expired, the client may have a refresh token they can use for a new access token instead of having to send the client ID and client secret again.  The refresh token generally expires any old access tokens.  The client secret should not be made publicly available in a github repo or sent to the client (all requests using it should be made server-side).  </li>
        <li>Authorization Code Grant: Very common, and similar to OAuth, user is redirected to API provider,
            logins in and grants permissions, then redirected back to intermediary with an authorization code.  The intermediary then sends requests to the API with the authorization code, a client ID and a client secret, to receive an access token and refresh token, used as with client credentials grant.  Tokens are now tied to a specific application and user, allowing a lot of control by the API provider.  The request that sends the client secret should again be done server-side.
        </li>
        <li>Implicit Grant: Similar to Authorization Code Grant, but does not send the client secret, and typically does not provide a refresh token. This allows applications to use the API who may not
        have the server-side capabilities to send requests and keep the client secret private. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>OWASP Top 10 Web App Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
    <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">owasp.org</a>
    <ul>
        <li>Injection: An attacker using SQL, noSQL, or other injection to send code in a
            command or query that tricks the interpreter into doing something unintended or
            give access to data without proper authorization
        </li>
        <li>Broken Authentication: Functions related to authentication and session management
            are often implemented incorrectly allowing attackers to assume other users identities
        </li>
        <li>Sensitive Data Exposure: Many web apps and APIS don't properly protect Sensitive
            data, or offer extra protection like encryption while at rest or in transit
        </li>
        <li>
            XML External Entities: Older or poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity
            references in XML documents, which can be used to disclose internal files and other attacks
        </li>
        <li>
            Broken Access Control: Restrictions on what authenticated users can access and do are often
            not properly enforced.
        </li>
        <li>
            Security Misconfiguration: the most common issue.  insecure default configurations, misconfigured
            HTTP headers, error messages containing sensitive info, OS/framework/library not patched and updated regularly
        </li>
        <li>
            Cross-site scripting XSS: when apps include untrusted data in a new web page or updates a page with user-supplied info without proper validation, can be used to redirect users, add malicious code, deface website
        </li>
        <li>
            Insecure Deserialization: Can result in remote code execution
        </li>
        <li>
            Using Components with known vulnerabilities: Libraries, frameworks, other modules that have known
            vulnerabilities used in the app
        </li>
        <li>
            Insufficient Logging and Monitoring: insufficient monitoring coupled with non existant or poorly
            integrated incident response allows attacks to go unnoticed for months, and worsening of attack
        </li>
    </ul>
