    <h2>Terms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Vulnerability: Sometimes called a security bug, is like other bugs in software, but is
            one that could be used for abuse. Try to be aware of the common ones to reduce them as
            much as you can.  Much of what you can do is just good programming practice like validating
            data entered by user, ensuring a single user can't take up too much time, build unit tests.
        </li>
        <li>Security Features: A first line of defense against abuse of vulnerabilities, includes
            HTTPS and CORS.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>OWASP Top 10 Web App Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
    <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">owasp.org</a>
    <ul>
        <li>Injection: An attacker using SQL, noSQL, or other injection to send code in a
            command or query that tricks the interpreter into doing something unintended or
            give access to data without proper authorization
        </li>
        <li>Broken Authentication: Functions related to authentication and session management
            are often implemented incorrectly allowing attackers to assume other users identities
        </li>
        <li>Sensitive Data Exposure: Many web apps and APIS don't properly protect Sensitive
            data, or offer extra protection like encryption while at rest or in transit
        </li>
        <li>
            XML External Entities: Older or poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity
            references in XML documents, which can be used to disclose internal files and other attacks
        </li>
        <li>
            Broken Access Control: Restrictions on what authenticated users can access and do are often
            not properly enforced.
        </li>
        <li>
            Security Misconfiguration: the most common issue.  insecure default configurations, misconfigured
            HTTP headers, error messages containing sensitive info, OS/framework/library not patched and updated regularly
        </li>
        <li>
            Cross-site scripting XSS: when apps include untrusted data in a new web page or updates a page with user-supplied info without proper validation, can be used to redirect users, add malicious code, deface website
        </li>
        <li>
            Insecure Deserialization: Can result in remote code execution
        </li>
        <li>
            Using Components with known vulnerabilities: Libraries, frameworks, other modules that have known
            vulnerabilities used in the app
        </li>
        <li>
            Insufficient Logging and Monitoring: insufficient monitoring coupled with non existant or poorly
            integrated incident response allows attacks to go unnoticed for months, and worsening of attack
        </li>
    </ul>
