    <h2>Terms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Vulnerability: Sometimes called a security bug, is like other bugs in software, but is
            one that could be used for abuse. Try to be aware of the common ones to reduce them as
            much as you can.  Much of what you can do is just good programming practice like validating
            data entered by user, ensuring a single user can't take up too much time, build unit tests.
        </li>
        <li>Security Features: A first line of defense against abuse of vulnerabilities, includes
            HTTPS and CORS.
        </li>
        <li>Authentication: Process used by applications to confirm identities of users.</li>
        <li>CIA: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, a good set of categories to consider when thinking about web security. Confidentiality is about enforcing who is and is not allowed to see certain data using things like user authentication and encryption, Integrity is about ensuring data is not changed and changes are reversible using things like database security and backups, and Availability is about data being available to users using things like hardware maintenance and disaster recovery plans.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>CORS</h2>
    <h3>Security Policy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When you visit a website, it comes from one server, but it may direct your browser to
            get assets from many different servers, like images, css files, fonts, etc.  This can pose
            a security risk to the client if e.g the page is hijacked and malicious code is downloaded from
            some server.
        </li>
        <li>Security policies can be implemented on servers to mitigate this risk</li>
        <li>Security policies are based on the origin of assets.  The origin is the combination of 
            the protocol (e.g. http://), the host (e.g. www.example.com/), and the port (e.g. 80 is default)
        </li>
        <li>Same-origin policy only allows a website to use assets from the same origin, for example a link
            on a webpage can only go to another webpage at the same origin, or an image can only come from the same origin. This is safe but can be too restrictive.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>CORS Security Policy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>CORS stands for Cross-origin resource sharing, and is a standard security policy that is less restrictive than same-origin but still provides protection.  CORS manages cross-origin http requests for assets</li>
        <li>CORS allows servers to specify who can access assets on them, and how to access them</li>
        <li>For example, many servers will allow cross origin GET requests from any requestor, but not allow push, pull, or delete requests.  Others may only allow requests from specific requestors.</li>
        <li>CORS is implemented in the backend and all done using request headers. There are a dozen or so CORS request header properties. e.g. Access-Control-Allow-Origin is set to * if all origins are allowed to make requests, or some specific list of domains if only certain origins are.</li>
        <li>Many HTTP methods like PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, will send a preflight request to the server that is sent before the real request is sent.  The server responds to the preflight request saying what methods are allowed from the user, and the user can send the real request if allowed, or cancel it if not. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Authentication</h2>
    <h3>Password Authentication</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Most common kind of authentication is for user to enter email/username and password.</li>
        <li>This is sent to a server that checks the information, and if valid, typically sends 
            back an authentication token (auth token).  The auth token can be used by the client
            to send with additional HTTP requests so the user doesn't have to keep logging in.  The auth
            token usually expires after a certain amount of time.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>API Key</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This kind of authentication is used for applications sending requests to third-party APIs.</li>
        <li>Public APIs will provide a developer portal of some kind, allowing the developer to register
            their application with the API and receive an API key unique to be used for that application.
        </li>
        <li>Allows the API to throttle requests, ensuring no spam or abuse, and ensure correct access permissions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>OAuth</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This is use with APIs that provide access to user data. Generally these APIs don't allow the developer to access user data with just an API Key.  They also need the user to allow it.</li>
        <li>One approach to this problem could be having the user provide their username and password to
            the intermediary application accessing the API.  However, this is insecure since the intermediary
            application now has the user's credentials and now full access to the user's account.
        </li>
        <li>OAuth is a better solution and is an open standard, i.e. guidelines, that many APIs follow in a roughly similar way.</li>
        <li>The generic OAuth flow, is the user is redirected from the intermediary app to a login site for the API provider, like Google.  The API provider has them login and decide what access to allow to 
        the intermediary.  Then the API provider redirects them back to the intermediary with an access token.
        The access token can be used by the intermediary to gain access to the user's data.  The access token may expire after a certain time.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>OAuth2</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A newer version of OAuth to handle different kinds of flows and levels of access</li>
        <li>Client Credentials Grant: This is similar to the API Key authentication, and is only used by the developer, the end user does not participate in the flow.  Instead of an API Key, the API can use a client ID and client secret, granted when the application is registered with the API.  These are exchanged for an access token and sometimes a refresh token.  Access tokens are sent with requests to the API as authorization, and typically expire frequently.  Once expired, the client may have a refresh token they can use for a new access token instead of having to send the client ID and client secret again.  The refresh token generally expires any old access tokens.  The client secret should not be made publicly available in a github repo or sent to the client (all requests using it should be made server-side).  </li>
        <li>Authorization Code Grant: Very common, and similar to OAuth, user is redirected to API provider,
            logins in and grants permissions, then redirected back to intermediary with an authorization code.  The intermediary then sends requests to the API with the authorization code, a client ID and a client secret, to receive an access token and refresh token, used as with client credentials grant.  Tokens are now tied to a specific application and user, allowing a lot of control by the API provider.  The request that sends the client secret should again be done server-side.
        </li>
        <li>Implicit Grant: Similar to Authorization Code Grant, but does not send the client secret, and typically does not provide a refresh token. This allows applications to use the API who may not
        have the server-side capabilities to send requests and keep the client secret private. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>OWASP Top 10 Web App Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
    <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">owasp.org</a>
    <ul>
        <li>Injection: An attacker using SQL, noSQL, or other injection to send code in a
            command or query that tricks an interpreter (of SQL or something else) into doing something unintended or
            give access to data without proper authorization.  E.g. in an entry field where you
            put in say a product name you could add in 'UNION SELECT username, password FROM user_table;'
            so the SQL query on the server runs "SELECT name, price, decription FROM products WHERE name="
            concatenated with the injected SQL.  OR the injected SQL could be a product name followed by 
            "; DROP TABLE users;" which would run a second sql statement to delete a table.  Or a password
            entry could inject 'dummypassword OR TRUE' which could trick a password checking condition to always be true.
        </li>
        <li>Broken Authentication: Functions related to authentication and session management
            are often implemented incorrectly allowing attackers to assume other users identities, This
            could be something like having an 'admin' user account that still has the default password 'admin',
            or a lack of rate-limiting for login attempts
        </li>
        <li>Sensitive Data Exposure: Many web apps and APIS don't properly protect Sensitive
            data, or offer extra protection like encryption while at rest or in transit.  This can be things like
            insecure storage, transmitting sensitive data, showing sensitive data to unauthorized parties, etc,
        </li>
        <li>
            XML External Entities: Older or poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity
            references in XML documents, which can be used to disclose internal files and other attacks, or
            possibly just run any code they want to in the back end.  Its like an injection attack except injeciton
            usually comes from input fields, whereas this comes from XML documents that can be sent, for example in
            the body of a post request.  Can be entirely avoided by not using XML.
        </li>
        <li>
            Broken Access Control: Restrictions on what authenticated users can access and do are often
            not properly enforced. This isn't as much about bypassing access controls, but vulnerabilities in
            the access controls themselves.  For example, being able to simply type in the username of someone at
            the end of a url to access their account page.
        </li>
        <li>
            Security Misconfiguration: the most common issue.  insecure default configurations, misconfigured
            HTTP headers, error messages containing sensitive info, OS/framework/library not patched and updated regularly,
            basically all security measures need to be configured correclty, not just left at defaults, and they need to be
            constantly  checked and updated as needed as the environment changes, not just set once and forget.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cross-site scripting XSS: when apps include untrusted data in a new web page or updates a page with user-supplied 
            info without proper validation, can be used to redirect users, add malicious code, deface website.  This is about
            client-side code being exploited.  For example
            a user could make a post on a social media website that other people can see.  But in their post the could write something like
            "&ltscript>alert('Uh-oh')&lt/script>" and put code in between teh script tags that gets added to the html of the displayed page,
            and is not treated like text, but treated like actual html tags with javascript in between it that will run when other
            users load the page.  This could also be done through faking iframe tags, or faking anchor tags that have an href that can
            run javascript.
        </li>
        <li>
            Insecure Deserialization: Can result in remote code execution.  This is about a common process where you take some actual code
            like an object or a function and you "serialize" it, usually meaning turning it into plain text, to perhaps send across the
            interwebs, and then you "deserialize" the incoming text to turn it back into an object or function or whatever.  This is when
            attackers alter the serialized data, so that when the data is deserialized it now contains something that will be converted into
            a malicious piece of code that will run.  Can be prevented by never deserializing external incoming data.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using Components with known vulnerabilities: Libraries, frameworks, other modules that have known
            vulnerabilities used in the app.  Usually updates and patches to software will fix all newly found
            vulnerabilites, but attackers will purposefully look out for announcements of known vulnerabilities and attack to get people
            who are out-of-date with their updates.  You can usually prevent this by keepign everything up to date, and abandoning the use of
            any software that is no longer maintained since they are no longer sending out patches for vulnerabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
            Insufficient Logging and Monitoring: insufficient monitoring coupled with non existant or poorly
            integrated incident response allows attacks to go unnoticed for months, and worsening of attack.  Good logging with detailed information 
            can quickly reveal e.g. that teh same ip address tried to log in to the admin account 20 times in a matter of 5 seconds and then logged in.
            This would alert you to a likely breach.
        </li>
