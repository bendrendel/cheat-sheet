    <h1>Testing</h1>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Software Testing </strong>Assessing the completeness and quality of computer software,
            usually by comparing actual behavior to expected behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Bugs </strong>An error, fault, or flaw making software behave in an unexpected way.</li>
        <li><strong>Manual Testing </strong>Testing done by a human interacting with the system</li>
        <li><strong>Automated Testing </strong>Testing done by software interacting with the system.
            This is faster and more reliable than manual testing and can be done more frequently, 
            often after every significant change to the software.</li>
        <li><strong>Test Code </strong>The code written to test software, in contrast to implementation
            code that is the code of the software itself.  Often stored along with implementation code.
            e.g. index.js is the implementation code and in the same folder is index-test.js with test code</li>
        <li><strong>Test Suite </strong>A collection of tests for an application</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation </strong>Any content separate from implementation code explaining how it
            works or how to use it.  Tests can be a form of documentation that is unique in that it is
            both readable by humans and computers to confirm it works as described.</li>
        <li><strong>Regression </strong>When previously tested functionality no longer passes the tests. Can
            happen when new features are implemented.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Test Driven Development (TDD)</h2>
    <p>Phases of test-drive development:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Add a test</strong> Convert requirements to tests, before code is written</li>
        <li><strong>Run all tests - fail</strong> The new tests should fail because the requirements haven't been met yet</li>
        <li><strong>Write simplest code to pass test</strong> Inelegant, hard-coded is fine</li>
        <li><strong>Run all tests - pass</strong> Revise code until all tests pass</li>
        <li><strong>Refactor</strong> Now make the code more logical, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Repeat</strong> Repeat this process for every new piece of functionality, generally using unit tests</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is often simplified as:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Red: </strong>Tests fail (red) because code doesn't meet requirement</li>
        <li><strong>Green: </strong>Write code as quickly as possible to make tests pass (green)</li>
        <li><strong>Refactor: </strong>Refactor code while keeping tests green</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Automated tests written and run by developers, testing small units of code, such as a single class, a function, a module, a method, etc.</li>
        <li>Needs to be used in conjuntion with integration testing, and other tests that test functionality of units working together</li>
        <li>Can be used as a design-specification, essentially they define what needs to be built and how it should work and can simultaneously be
            used to test if requirements are met.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Integration Testing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This tests modules which have been unit tested, and aggregates them to test as a group.  Happens after unit testing,
            but before validation and system testing.
        </li>
        <li>Different methods can be used such as big-bang testing which combines large aggregates of modules, or can systematically
            test smaller aggregates first, building up to larger aggregates.
        </li>
    </ul>
