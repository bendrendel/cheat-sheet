    <h1>Testing</h1>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Software Testing </strong>Assessing the completeness and quality of computer software,
            usually by comparing actual behavior/outcome to expected behavior/outcome.</li>
        <li><strong>Bugs </strong>An error, fault, or flaw making software behave in an unexpected way.</li>
        <li><strong>Manual Testing </strong>Testing done by a human interacting with the system</li>
        <li><strong>Automated Testing </strong>Testing done by software interacting with the system.
            This is faster and more reliable than manual testing and can be done more frequently, 
            often after every significant change to the software.  Developers use test frameworks to organize
            automated tests.</li>
        <li><strong>Test Code </strong>The code written to test software, in contrast to implementation
            code that is the code of the software itself.  Often stored along with implementation code.
            e.g. index.js is the implementation code and in the same folder is index-test.js with test code</li>
        <li><strong>Test Suite </strong>A collection of tests for an application.  A good test suite is fast, complete, reliable, isolated (tests don't have side effects), maintainable, and expressive (easy to read and descriptive, making it useful for documentation)</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation </strong>Any content separate from implementation code explaining how it
            works or how to use it.  Tests can be a form of documentation that is unique in that it is
            both readable by humans and computers to confirm it works as described.</li>
        <li><strong>Regression </strong>When previously tested functionality no longer passes the tests. Can
            happen when new features are implemented.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Test Driven Development (TDD)</h2>
    <p>Phases of test-drive development:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Add a test</strong> Convert requirements to tests, before code is written</li>
        <li><strong>Run all tests - fail</strong> The new tests should fail because the requirements haven't been met yet</li>
        <li><strong>Write simplest code to pass test</strong> Inelegant, hard-coded is fine</li>
        <li><strong>Run all tests - pass</strong> Revise code until all tests pass</li>
        <li><strong>Refactor</strong> Now make the code more logical, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Repeat</strong> Repeat this process for every new piece of functionality, generally using unit tests</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is often simplified as:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Red: </strong>Tests fail (red) because code doesn't meet requirement</li>
        <li><strong>Green: </strong>Write code as quickly as possible to make tests pass (green)</li>
        <li><strong>Refactor: </strong>Refactor code while keeping tests green</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Automated tests written and run by developers, testing small units of code, such as a single class, a function, a module, a method, etc.</li>
        <li>Needs to be used in conjuntion with integration testing, and other tests that test functionality of units working together</li>
        <li>Can be used as a design-specification, essentially they define what needs to be built and how it should work and can simultaneously be
            used to test if requirements are met.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Integration Testing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This tests modules which have been unit tested, and aggregates them to test as a group.  Happens after unit testing,
            but before validation and system testing.
        </li>
        <li>Different methods can be used such as big-bang testing which combines large aggregates of modules, or can systematically
            test smaller aggregates first, building up to larger aggregates.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mocha</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Mocha is a javascript test framework, which should be installed using <code>npm install mocha -D</code> in the root directory of a project, to save it to the dev dependcies of the project (-D)</li>
        <li>Once installed, it can be executed from the project root directory with <code>./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha</code>, however it is more common to set it as the test script
        in the project's package.json by setting <code>"test": "mocha"</code> in the scripts object, so mocha can be executed using <code>npm test</code>. This will run the full test suite instead of having
        to run each test in your test folder individually.  You can put <code>"test": "mocha test/**/*_test.js"</code> to specifically run anything in any folder of the test directory that ends in _test.</li>
        <li>Typically the architecture is you'll have a test folder in the root of your project, with one or more js files containing tests.  You might have an index.js file, and a corresponding index_test.js file in the test folder.  In the index_test.js you'll typically need to require in index.js at the top (and index.js will need a module.exports statement) so you can test the functionality in index.js.  You'll also typically require in the assert core module.  You don't have to require in Mocha if its been installed as described above.</li>
        <li>The <code>describe()</code> and <code>it()</code> are mocha methods that provide structure to your test code.  They both accept two arguments, a descriptive string and a callback function.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><code>describe()</code> groups related tests together. the first argument should describe the grouping, and the callback function contains the test code and may include nested
            describe() functions to create subgroups of tests</li>
            <li><code>it()</code> defines the actual tests.  the first argument should describes the functionality tested such as 'returns argument with highest value', and the callback function should
            define the test</li>
            <li>Example code: 
                <code><pre>
                    describe('Math', () => {
                        describe('.max', () => {
                            it('returns the argument with the highest value', () => {
                                // Your test goes here
                            });
                            it('returns -Infinity when no arguments are provided', () => {
                                // Your test goes here
                            });
                        });
                    });
                </pre></code>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>The <code>assert</code> library is a core node module, and is commonly used with Mocha to perform a test. It must be imported to the test file with <code>const assert = require('assert');</code></li>
        <ul>
            <li><code>assert.ok()</code> accepts a single conditional statement such as <code>assert.ok(myVar === 3)</code> and throws an AssertionError if condition is false.  This communciates to mocha that a test has failed and mocha then logs it to the console.</li>
            <li><code>assert.equal()</code> and <code>assert.strictEqual()</code> can and should (for a more expressive, easier to read test) be used instead of .ok() when you just want to test if two items are equal, .equal does a loose == comparison and .strictEqual does a strict === comparison. e.g. <code>assert.strictEqual(result, expected)</code> where typically the result/actual is put first and the expected second</li>
            <li><code>assert.deepEqual()</code> should be used when comparing equality between two objects or two arrays. Comparing distinct but identical objects or arrays with == or === will result in false, because the objects/arrays are not in the same location in memory.</li>
            <li>There are other assert methods for specific circumstances that should generally be used instead of the more generic ok() method for more expressive tests that are easier to read</li>     
            <li>Example Code:
                <code><pre>
                    describe('+', () => {
                        it('returns the sum of its arguments', () => {
                            // Write assertion here
                            assert.ok(3 + 4 === 7);
                        });
                    });
                </pre></code>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Test Phases are a good way to organize the test code inside an it statement callback function, to make it more maintainable, readable, and expressive</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Setup: create any variables, conditions, etc. needed to perform your test</li>
            <li>Exercise: using your setup, execute the actual functionality being tested</li>
            <li>Verify: using the outcome of the excerise, compare to expected outcome, can write an if statement to make this comparison and throw error if it fails, but the assert library provides a more compact way of doing that, making the test more expressive.</li>
            <li>Teardown: not always needed, this resets any conditions changed during the test such as altering files or directory structure, changing read/write permissions for a file, editing database records.
                This ensures your test is isolated.
            </li>
            <li>Example Code:
                <code><pre>
                    describe('appendFileSync', () => {
                        it('writes a string to text file at given path name', () => {

                            // Setup
                            const path = './message.txt';
                            const str = 'Hello Node.js';
                            
                            // Exercise: write to file
                            fs.appendFileSync(path, str);

                            // Verify: compare file contents to string
                            const contents = fs.readFileSync(path);
                            assert.ok(contents.toString() === str);

                            // Teardown: delete path
                            fs.unlinkSync(path);
                        });
                    });
                </pre></code>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Hooks are generally a better way to write setup and teardown code instead of including it directly in your it callback code.  Hooks are included inside the describe callback function along with the
            it function calls.  Hooks include <code>beforeEach(), afterEach(), before(), after()</code> and accept a single callback function as an argument.  For example, the provided callback function for afterEach() will
            run after every time an it callback runs in the same describe callback.  This is especially important to use for teardown code because it ensures the teardown code will run even if the it callback ends early
            due to an assertError or other error being thrown.  The teardown code would not run after the error if it was included in the it callback directly.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Example code:
                <code><pre>
                    describe('example', () => {
                    
                        afterEach(() => {
                            // teardown goes here
                        });
                        
                        it('.sample', () => {
                            // test goes here
                        });
                    });
                </pre></code>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
