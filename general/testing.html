    <h1>Testing</h1>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Software Testing </strong>Assessing the completeness and quality of computer software,
            usually by comparing actual behavior to expected behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Bugs </strong>An error, fault, or flaw making software behave in an unexpected way.</li>
        <li><strong>Manual Testing </strong>Testing done by a human interacting with the system</li>
        <li><strong>Automated Testing </strong>Testing done by software interacting with the system.
            This is faster and more reliable than manual testing and can be done more frequently, 
            often after every significant change to the software.</li>
        <li><strong>Test Code </strong>The code written to test software, in contrast to implementation
            code that is the code of the software itself.  Often stored along with implementation code.
            e.g. index.js is the implementation code and in the same folder is index-test.js with test code</li>
        <li><strong>Test Suite </strong>A collection of tests for an application</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation </strong>Any content separate from implementation code explaining how it
            works or how to use it.  Tests can be a form of documentation that is unique in that it is
            both readable by humans and computers to confirm it works as described.</li>
        <li><strong>Regression </strong>When previously tested functionality no longer passes the tests. Can
            happen when new features are implemented.</li>
    </ul>
