        <h1>HTTP</h1>
        <p><strong>HTTP: </strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol, a client-server protocol designed in early 90s
            for how to structure requests and responses sent over TCP or TLS-encrypted TCP connections.
            It is the foundation of any data exchange on the web.  Application-level, human readable, 
            hides complexity of proxies and modems, routers, etc.</p>
        <p><strong>HTTP/1.1</strong> a revision of the original HTTP/1.0 with less delay, 
            it allows multiple request/response cycles over a single TCP connection
            HTTP/1.0 required a separate TCP connection for each request/response cycle</p>
        <p><strong>HTTP/2</strong> Messages are embedded in a binary structure (frame) allowing optimizations
            like compression and multiplexing, not human-readable though same concept</p>
        <p><strong>HTTPS</strong> is HTTP Secure and encrypts the data sent and recieved, must be supported by the 
            server and business must be certified</p>
        <p><strong>Various Features: </strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sessions: </strong>Through the use of cookies and the HTTP header, can create a stateful session 
            allowing multiple requests to share the same context or state, working around REST statelessness</li>
            <li><strong>Caching: </strong>Can be controlled by HTTP with server instructing proxies and clients about
            what to cache and for how long</li>
            <li><strong>Origin Constraint: </strong>Can be relaxed with HTTP headers</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication: </strong>Basic authentication provided through headers or cookies</li>
            <li><strong>Proxy and tunneling: </strong>Allow going through server or client intranets that hide
            IP addresses from outside computers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>HTTP Requests</h2>
        <p><strong>Requests: </strong>Consists of a Method, a resource path, the protocol version, and
            optional headers to convey information to servers and an optional body with data</p>
        <p><strong>HTTP Method: </strong>define the type of operation to perform, 
            many types but four most common are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>GET - retrieve a specific resource or collection of resources</li>
            <li>POST - create a new resource - requires sending data</li>
            <li>PUT - update a specific resource</li>
            <li>DELETE - remove a specific resource</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Protocol: </strong>HTTP/1.1</p>
        <p><strong>Resource Path: </strong>Specifies the resource upon which to perform the http method, 
            designed to generally be heirarchical and easy to interpret, using plurals for collections of resources, 
            and id numbers for specific resources if needed.  e.g. /customers/57/orders/2, 
            for perhaps getting or deleting the 2nd order of the 57th customer, or /customers/57/photos, 
            for perhaps posting a new photo to the photos collection for customer 57</p>
        <p><strong>headers: </strong>contains different information about the request for servers</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accept field: </strong>The header's accept field specifies the type of data it can recieve from the server by MIME Type, can specify multiple types it is willing to accept</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Host: </strong>server address</p>
        <p><strong>Example HTTP Request: </strong></p>
        <p><code>GET /examplepage.html HTTP/1.1</code>  &lt-- Method, path to resource, protocol</p>
        <p><code>Accept: text/html, application/xhtml</code>  &lt-- Accept header field</p>
        <p><code>Host: www.example.com</code>  &lt-- Server address</p>
        <p>Additional lines possibly, data payload</p>
    

        <h2>HTTP Responses</h2>
        <p><strong>Responses: </strong>Consist of protocol version, status code, status message, HTTP headers
            and optionally a body containing fetched resources</p>
        <p><strong>Protocol: </strong>HTTP/1.1</p>
        <p><strong>Status Code and Message: </strong>status code indicating if the operation was successful or if there was an error of some kind, should return most specific error code posssible</p>
        <ul>
            <li>200 (0K) - standard response for successful GET and PUT requests</li>
            <li>201 (CREATED) - standard response for successful POST requests</li>
            <li>204 (NO CONTENT) - standarad respons for successful DELETE requests</li>
            <li>400 (BAD REQUEST) - bad syntax, excessive size, or another client error</li>
            <li>403 (FORBIDDEN) - client does not have permission to access the resource</li>
            <li>404 (NOT FOUND) - resource wasn't found</li>
            <li>500 (INTERNAL SERVER ERROR) - standard response for errors without more information</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Headers: </strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Content-type field: </strong>If sending the client a data payload in the response body, this specifies the MIME type of the data and should match one of the types in the Accept field of the request</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Body: </strong>contains data payload</p>
        <p><strong>JSON: </strong>JavaScript Object Notation, common format in which data is transferred between client and server on the web.  It is the de facto standard to facilitate storing and sending data between all programming languages.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>JSON is a text string that contains a pair of curly braces filled with name-value pairs, where the name and value are separated by a colon, and each pair is separated with a comma (no ending comma after the last pair).  This is similar to javascript object syntax, except every name must be contained in double-quotes.  Javascript only requires names in double quotes when the contain a space or certain other special characters.</li>
            <li>JSON strings may be returned as data from a server or something like that, or they may be contained in their own file, with the extension .json.</li>
            <li>The data types of values in the JSON object can be strings (in double-quotes - not single-quotes which is okay in normal javascript), numbers (no quotes or any special container), objects (contained in curly braces, name-value separated by colon, comma delimited between name-value pairs, and with names in double quotes), arrays (contained in square brackets and comma delimited), boolean (keyword true or false with no quotes or any special container), or null (keyword null with no quotes or any special container).</li>
            <li>JSON does not support certain data types as values, notably dates.  Dates are commonly stored as strings in the standard ISO 8601 format: "2014-01-01T23:28:56.782Z", and all programming languages should have built-in Json facilities to automatically convert this string to a date data type in that programming lanaguage.</li>
            <li>Every programming language will have JSON facilities to help handle json.  In javascript, the built-in JSON class contains these methods.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>JSON.parse(myJsonString) will convert a json string called myJsonString into a normal javascript object.</li>
                <li>JSON.stringify(myObject) will convert a regular javascript object called myObject into a
                    JSON string.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <strong>Example HTTP Response: </strong>
        <p><code>HTTP/1.1 200 (OK)</code>  &lt-- Protocol (indicates protocol understood), HTTP status message</p>
        <p><code>Content-Type: text/html</code>  &lt-- Type of content being sent</p>
        <p>Followed by the content requested in the Response Body</p>
    </body>
