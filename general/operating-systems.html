    <h1>Operating Systems</h1>

    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Operating systems are the central piece of software running on every computer.  It manages the hardware and software resources of a system (e.g. processor, disk space, memory, keypad, network connection, etc), and provides a stable and consistent way for other software to interact with the hardware without knowing hardware details.  The first task involves managing CPU usage, memory, i/o, etc. to ensure demands on limited system resources are used for the greatest good of the user and applications.  The second task involves providing a consistent API to software developers that manages all the hardware details so other software doesn't have to and will still run on different machines, when hardware is upgraded, if memory capacity changes, regardless of what type of printer is connected, etc.  Users interact with the OS and its managers through the user interface.  Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and Unix are the major Operating Systems.  There are four essential managers of every operating system that work together:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Memory Manager: Manages RAM (main memory), scans every request for memory and allows allocation if available, takes care of deallocation</li>
            <li>Process Manager: Manages the CPU, keeps track of status each process, handles jobs as they enter system and the processes associated with those jobs</li>
            <li>Device Manager: Monitors every device, channel, and control unit, chooses most effecient way to allocate system devices that are connected.</li>
            <li>File Manager: Checks every file on the system, data files, program files, compilers, installed applications, sets permissions at user level.</li>
            <li>Network Manager: A fifth manager that is practically essential these days, Allows sharing of hardware and software resources while controlling access</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
