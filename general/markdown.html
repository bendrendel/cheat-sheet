        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Markdown is a text-formatting language designed for the web with PERL</li>
            <li>Widely used in software/technical documentation, 
                many communication applications like skype, major websites like wordpress, 
                writing blogs posts for a website, to take notes, implemented in emails, 
                and multiple places in GitHub (Gists, comments in issues and pull requests,
                and files with markdown extension)</li>
            <li>It is designed to be lighter weight than HTML to be more accessible, 
                but can't do nearly as much as HTML.  It is designed as a subset of HTML.</li>
            <li>The original markdown was designed in 2004, but more flavors have been 
                created since then that incorporate more features from HTML. CommonMark is
                a major one.  Github flavored markdown (GFM) is another one that expands upon
                commonmark.  Trello is another big one that has its own implementation of
                markdown.
            </li>
            <li>Markdown processors or parsers are included in certain software that can read
                markdown, it converts markdown to HTML</li>
            <li>File extension is .markdown or .md</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Readme Files</h2>
        <p>Every programming project should include a README.md file, GitHub automatically
            displays it on the landing page of the repository. It should contain:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Title (h1) usually the project name and possibly brief description 
                and good section titles (h2), possibly subsections (h3-h6)</li>
            <li>Introduction in a few sentences explaining the point of the project,
                what problems it solves or incentive for creating it. For coding interview projects,
                explain how requirements have been met.</li>
            <li>The technologies used in the project, including libraries and versions</li>
            <li>How to run the project, if there are minimum hardware requirements, how to
                run in local environment or install it, for web projects it may jsut be a link to the deployed project. For installing, provide step by step instructions like clone from 
                github, install things, etc.</li>
            <li>Usage, how to use the project maybe with screenshots</li>
            <li>How to contribute if applicable, possibly would go in its own file</li>
            <li>credits, authors</li>
            <li>license</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Optionally, include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Table of contents - for extensive documents, linked to headings</li>
            <li>Illustrations - logo, diagrams, screenshots, etc</li>
            <li>Scope of functionalities/features - if not obvious</li>
            <li>Examples of use</li>
            <li>Project status - especially if currently being developed, explaining planned changes</li>
            <li>Sources - e.g. if following a tutorial, or inspired by another project</li>
            <li>Other information - author, contact info, license, how to contribute, for coding 
                interviews could include info on the time/space complexity of alogrithms/data structures
                used in the problem.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>[Displayed link name](url "optional tool tip")</li>
            <li>url could be relative reference to repository file like ../blob/master/LICENSE
                or on the web like https://google.com</li>
            <li>url could be link to a heading in the document, where the heading is all lowercase

                e.g. [Section A](#section-a)</li>

                defined later in document like so:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Optional displayed link name][reference text]</li>

        <h3>Inline Code</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For code snippets (html, css, js, anything) use backticks `const myVar`

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>HTML</h3>
