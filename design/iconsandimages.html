        <!--use classes fa-lg (33% larger than default), fa-2x, fa-3x, fa-4x, and fa-5x to increase icon size above default-->

        <p>few icons are truly universal, so research before using, see if other sites use it and include text alongside it if unclear</p>
        
        <h2>Assets</h2>
        <p>Assets are images and other media presented on your web page</p>
        <p>Images should be sized properly so they are not too large and overflowing their container, and causing slow load time</p>
        <p>Crop images to size with Photoshop, GIMP, online try <a href="https://www.pixlr.com">pixlr.com</a></p>
        <p>For simple images, try converting images to SVG for smaller files and faster loading, <a href="https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-svg">online-convert.com</a></p>

        <h2>Image file types</h2>
        <p><strong>Finding Images: </strong>Most images on the web are copywrited so you need to be careful</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.unsplash.com">Unsplash</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.google.com/images">Google Images</a> Set the usage right filter to "Labeled for reuse" or similar</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>JPEG: </strong>highly compressible, JPEG and PNG can be used for photos, but JPEG preferred for images with significant detail, when saving 85% quality is web standard</p>
        <p><strong>PNG: </strong>lossless, preferred for images with less detail like logos, can be used instead of JPEG for photos/images with more empty space</p>
        <p><strong>SVG: </strong>scalable vector graphics, usually smallest file size, roughly 50% less data than JPEG or PNG, load quickly, good for hi res screens, becoming widely used for icons/logos</p>

        <h2>Responsive Images</h2>
        <p>Use responsive image techniques to use smaller image resolutions on smaller screens to minimize data usage, or to use different crops of images on different size screens for aesthetic reasons.  Chrome DevTools device mode is helpful for testing, in particular allows for changing the Device Pixel Ratio, so you can simulate high def screens for high def images.</p>

        <h3>Picture Element</h3>
        <p>Use the picture element for fine-grain control over which image is displayed at different screen widths, useful for different cropped images for different screen sizes, i.e. you want the image to truly look different at different screen sizes.  Often you want more landscape images on big screens, that become more cropped to a square on smaller screens</p>

        <pre><code>
            &ltpicture>
                &ltsource srcset="./images/large-version.jpg" media="(min-width: 1200px)">
                &ltsource srcset="./images/medium-version.jpg" media="(min-width: 760px)">
                &ltimg src="./images/small-version.jpg" alt="my image">
            &lt/picture>
        </code></pre>


        <h3>Browser Detection</h3>

        <p>You can also use the img element with a srcset property to include multiple different resolutions of an image, with each image tagged with the image's width in pixels.  Browsers will automatically pick the smallest image that will still be sharp.  If the browser window shrinks, then it won't download the smaller image if it has already downloaded a larger image since the larger image will be sharp enough already (must clear cache to get smaller image to download).  In determining which resolution to use, the browser assumes the image will take the full screen width.  If this isn't the case, then you should include the sizes property and set it equal to the pixel width of the image on the screen, so the browser can use this to determine the appropriate resolution.  If the image width grows and shrinks with the screen, then set sizes to the widest width the image can possibly have.  You can include media queries in sizes to say, e.g. the image is 900px wide for screens greater than 1000px, and 100vw for all smaller screens, e.g. sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 900px, 100vw".  Overall, the browser detection technique is best when you don't want the image's appearance/cropping to change with different screen sizes, you just want to optimize data usage.</p>
        <pre><code>
            &ltimg sizes="404px" srcset="./images/small-version.jpg 570w, ./images/medium-version.jpg 1200w, images/large-version.jpg 1920w" alt="my image">
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Combination</h3>
        <p>You can combine the techniques above by using the picture element to display different crops of the image at different screen sizes, but include multiple resolutions of each crop in the srcset property of the img element and source elements.  This will allow for higher resolution images to be used if the screen has a high dpi like 4K monitors or retina screens.</p>

        <pre><code>
            &ltpicture>
                &ltsource srcset="./images/large-version.jpg 1800w, ./images/large-version-hi-dpi.jpg 3600w" media="(min-width: 1200px)">
                &ltsource srcset="./images/medium-version.jpg 1200w, ./images/medium-version-hi-dpi.jpg 2400w" media="(min-width: 760px)">
                &ltimg srcset="./images/small-version.jpg 760w, ./images/small-version-hi-dpi.jpg 1520w" alt="my image">
            &lt/picture>
        </code></pre>

        <h2>Lazy Loading</h2>
        <h3>Installing lazysizes Package</h3>
        <p>You can install the lazysizes npm package for a project to load images only once they are scrolled
            to on the webpage, so that the user doesn't have to download all images at once when they first 
            reach the webpage.
        </p>
        <p>run <code>npm install lazysizes</code> in the root directory of your project to install the package</p>
        <p>add <code>import 'lazysizes'</code> to a js file that is linked in to your html file</p>

        <h3>Marking images for lazy loading</h3>
        <p>In your html file, you'll want to lazy load images that are further down the screen.  Images at the
            top of the screen should load instantly since the user will always see them when visiting.  Also,
            you may only want to do this for jpgs and pngs due to their size, and not do it for svgs since they
            have small file sizes.
        </p>
        <p>Add a class of <code>"lazyload"</code> to any <code>img</code> tag you want loaded lazily.  If using
        the picture element, you only need to add the class to the img tag in the picture element</p>
        <p>Also change the <code>src</code> or <code>srcset</code> attribute in any <code>img</code> or
            <code>source</code> tags to <code>data-src</code> or <code>data-srcset</code> otherwise
            the browser will automatically download images in the <code>src</code> and <code>srcset</code>
            attributes.
        </p>
