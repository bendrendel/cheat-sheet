        <h2>UX Design</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Preliminary research: </strong>Who is the audience, what are the requirements, use cases, competitor and industry research (prevailing UX trends/best practices)</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Design sites: <a href="https://dribbble.com">Dribbble</a> <a href="https://www.behance.net">Behance</a></p></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>2. User Flows </strong>Planning out the number of screens and how the user will flow through them, including where the user is likely to come from initially (marketing channel) and where they should end up, often in the form of a simple flow chart diagram</p>
        <p><strong>3. Visual Design Steps </strong>Sketch > Handdrawn Wireframe > Digital Higer-def Wireframe > Low-fidelity Prototype > Hi-fidelity Prototype > User Testing > Visual > Code</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How many steps depends on the complexity and importance of the design, and for simple sites may go straight from Sketch to Code</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>4. User Testing </strong> Can start testing with users once you have the interactive prototype, wireframes usually aren't great for user testing since they're not interactive</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Testing sites: <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/">UsabilityHub</a> <a href="https://prottapp.com/features/">Prott</a></li>
        </ul>
        

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p><strong>Wireframe: </strong>Plain black-and-white diagram of website or app for planning layout and interaction, goal is for user to process information in a way you want them to, add annotations as needed for reviewers or notes about prototype</p>
        <p><strong>Important considerations when wireframing: </strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Organizing everything to support the user's most significant goals in a given context, eliminating distracting extra info, links, etc.</li>
            <li>Which information should be prominent/seen first</li>
            <li>What does the user expect to see where by convention (navigation at top next to log, search box top right, etc.)</li>
            <li>What buttons are needed to complete actions? Simple instructional wording for calls-to-action.</li>
            <li>Trust-building elements that build trust in your customers, like predictable behavior, buttons/boxes in expected places, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Wireframe types: </strong>Often start with handdrawn wireframes for easy iteration, adding detail with iterations, and then move to higher definition digital wireframes</p>
        <p><strong>Software: </strong>Can use any graphic design software like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, GIMP, but nice to use UX Design Software that allows for seamless transition from wireframe to prototype later</p>

        </ul>
    
        <h2>Prototypes</h2>
        <p><strong>Prototype: </strong>An interactive, mid to hi fidelity representation of site/app, has key interactions of final product so it is user-testable, good for pitching to stakeholders, learn about problem and get user-tested feedback, often have multiple versions to help test all possible solutions to a problem</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Prototype types: </strong>Low-fidelity prototype has limited functionality such as a clickable wireframe or scketch, Hi-fidelity prototype simulates much more functionality and design detail</p>
        <p><strong>Software: </strong>Can use presentation software like PowerPoint for limited prototypes, but nice to use specialized design software that usually have built in collaboration features to get feedback and can import wireframes, also can create native prototypes which are actually written code in situations that are hard to model with design software</p>
