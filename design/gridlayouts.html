        <h2>Grid Systems</h2>
        <p><strong>Grid Systems: </strong>Visual Designers of all kind use grids to organize designs, 
            allowing for easier navigation, better alignment, consistency across pages</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Block Grid: </strong>Or manuscript-style grid developed by bookmakers to structure text on pages</li>
            <li><strong>Column Grid: </strong>Used for news designs to break page into sections, also the most common 
                layout for webpages, breaking full width of page into columns. In mid 2000's the holy grail was having
                a three-column website layout with sidebars of links and content in the middle. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Column Grid Layouts</h2>
        <p><strong>Columns: </strong>The vertical sections spanning the width of the page, number of columns depends 
            on design and screen size</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Content can span multiple columns, like taking up all the columns, or only half, or creating a wider set 
                of columns like 3 pieces of content taking of 4 columns each across a 12 column layout</li>
            <li>Responsive designs will use a different number of columns depending on screen size, e.g. 12 or 16 columns 
                for desktop, 9 for tablets, and 3 or 4 for mobile</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Gutters: </strong>The negative space between each column, always one less gutter than number of columns, 
            help ensure columns don't run together</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Content should not spill into a gutter unless it spans into the next column</li>
            <li>Should also have horizontal gutters between rows, don't have to be same width as column gutters and are 
                often larger</li>
            <li>Gutters should be significantly less width than columns or rows, two small makes it hard to distinguish 
                content, and too large makes it hard to follow</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Margins: </strong>Space on the left and right sides of a column-based grid, keep designs from running 
            into edges of browser, vary based on design and screen size,
            e.g. wide screens may have large margins but small screens may have margins no bigger than a gutter</p>
        <p><strong>Rows: </strong>Invisible boxes that group content together by height, used to separate and force content 
            into a new row instead of taking up remaining columns in the previous row</p>

        <h2>Whitespace</h2>
        <p><strong>Whitespace: </strong>Or negative space is the empty space between elements, like gutters, padding around 
            text, etc. not necessarily white</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Elements should have ample room to breath using whitespace to enhance usability and focus attention, but 
                too much whitespace can interupt navigation</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Passive Whitespace: </strong>Or micro whitespace, or unconsidered space, is whitespace that doesn't 
            guide the user anywhere, often referring to text properties like line height</p>
        <p><strong>Active Whitespace: </strong>Or macro whitespace, used intentionally to emphaize content or guide users,
            generally refers to space between elements to visually separate content to help guide and focus users</p>
