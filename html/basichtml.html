        <h2 id="first-header">Basic structure of HTML</h2>
        <p>File extension is .html</p>
        <p>HTML is composed of elements</p>
        <p>Most elements are composed of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag containing a slash</p>
        <p>Some elements (empty elements) only consist of an opening tag, known as a self-closing tag, may include or omit slash at end of tag</p>
        <p>The tags contain the element name such as p</p>
        <p>Attributes can be included in opening tags and consist of a name and possibly value, like id="my-element"</p>
        <p>Elements can be nested, creating a hierarchical tree of child/parent/sibling relationships, parents often referred to as containers</p>
        <p>Whitespace in HTML file is ignored, and should be used to make the file easier to read, 2 space indentation is W3C convention</p>
        <p>HTML is permissive when it comes to errors, meaning it still works even if there are syntax errors because browsers have built-in rules to interpret bad syntax.  <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">Markup Validation Service</a> is a site to check for errors in your HTML</p>
        <!--HTML can also have comments like so-->

        <h2>Important structural elements</h2>
        <p><strong>DOCTYPE</strong> HTML documents should always start with the !DOCTYPE html document type declaration to ensure browser interpret it correctly</p>
        <p><strong>html</strong> They always need the html element (aka root element) so the browser knows where the content is to interpret as html</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>lang attribute: </strong>lang attribute helps SEO, translation tools, browser dictionaries, TTS voice profile and character set, 
                can set on html tag, or on specific tags if you change language inside that tag</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>head</strong> Usually the head tag is the first child element of html and contains metadata that is not directly displayed on scree</p>
        <p><strong>title</strong> The head contains the title element, which is displayed on the browser or tab title bar</p>
        <p><strong>meta charset</strong> Sets the character set the document should use, UTF-8 includes most 
            characters from most languages to ensure doc can handle any text content. helps avoid certain 
            problems</p>
        <p><strong>body</strong> Only content inside the body tag can be displayed on the screen</p>

        <p>The span element used to <span>separate small pieces of content</span> that is inline with other text</p>
        <p>The em (emphasis) element <em>generally used</em> to separate text inline as italic</p>
        <p>The strong element <strong>generally used</strong> to separate text inline as bold</p>
        <p>The br (break) element used to create a line break and is self-closing</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Other important elements</h2>

        <p>The div (division) element used for dividing page into blocks or sections</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The ul (unordered list) element</li>
            <li>Must be used with the li (list item) element as children</li>
