            collecting information from users it traditionally done through html forms
            inormation is collected on the front-end and sent to the back-end for processing, usually stored 
            in a database

            forms consist of a form element with children of input, select, textarea
            each input/select/textarea needs a name attribute
            each will also have a value attribute but how that gets assigned varies, value is case-sensitive

            upon submission, an HTTP request is sent back to the server, to the route specified
            in the form's action attribute, as either a POST or GET request per the method attribute.
            upon submission, all values are converted to strings and "name=value" gets sent for each 
            input/select/textarea, if the method is GET, then the name value pairs get sent as
            query strings added to the URL, but if the method is POST, then the name value
            pairs get sent as data within the HTTP request.

            labels tie to input by setting for attribute equal to id of input
            when user clicks on the label it selects the corresponding input
            avoid label-less inputs fields to help with usability

            can use inputs with the hidden attribute added, in order to send a value when the form is
            submitted that the user cannot edit or see.  helpful to, e.g. send an id value perhaps
            that is prepopulated to go along with the get or post request.

                for checkbox and radio inputs, you need to give each checkbox or radio a value but it is not 
                displayed, its just what gets sent
                give all checkboxes or radios in the same group the same name attribute
                checkbox allows for multiple selections in same group, radio allows for only one

                fieldset is often used to draw a box around related radio buttons, with legend as a header,
                but it is optional and only a visual change, not fundamental to making radio buttons work,
                and it can be used to put a box around any related form inputs, e.g. you could have one
                with a legend of Personal Info, with many inputs of different types inside.

        <h2>Form Validation</h2>
        <strong>Purpose of validation: </strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure accuracy of data, e.g. valid email address</li>
            <li>ensure non-duplicative data, e.g. existing username</li>
            <li>ensure complete data, e.g. no missing fields</li>
            <li>protection, e.g. secure password, no injected code through form</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Regular Expressions: </strong>Regex or regexp, since data submitted through forms 
            are stored as strings, can use regex for validation.  Quite complex, but some basic examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a — Matches one character that is a (not b, not aa, and so on).</li>
            <li>abc — Matches a, followed by b, followed by c.</li>
            <li>ab?c—Matches a, optionally followed by a single b, followed by c. ( ac or abc)</li>
            <li>ab*c—Matches a, optionally followed by any number of bs, followed by c. 
                ( ac , abc, abbbbbc, and so on).</li>
            <li>a|b — Matches one character that is a or b.</li>
            <li>abc|xyz — Matches exactly abc or exactly xyz (but not abcxyz or a or y, and so on).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Client-side Validation: </strong>validation included in the client code, won't allow user 
            to submit form if anything is invalid, either prevents certain values from being entered at all or 
            will display alert with reason, faster than communicating with back-end</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Built-in HTML Validation</strong></p>
                <p>Uses validation attributes in form elements. Has better performance the javascript validation 
                    but not as customizable.  Input must follow rules of all validation attributes to be 
                    considered valid, otherwise will be invalid and will prevent form submission and show 
                    error message.</p>
                <p>When an element is valid it will match the :valid CSS pseudo-class, allowing for styling</p>
                <p>When invalid, it will match the :invalid CSS psuedo-class and sometimes other more specific 
                    ones like :out-of-range</p>
                <p><strong>Validation attributes:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>required attribute, inputs with the required attribute can be styled with psuedo-selector 
                        input:required, which selects all inputs with the attribute.  To specifically get ones that 
                        are required and empty, you can use input:invalid:required</li>
                    <li>min/max attributes for inputs of type number or type range</li>
                    <li>minlength/maxlength attribute for inputs of type text, password, or textarea. consider adding 
                        some javascript that counts down the remaining characters available</li>
                    <li>type attribute can specify number, email, or other preset types, which compares
                        to a regex behind the scenes
                    </li>
                    <li>pattern attribute for inputs of type text,password, which requires input to match a specified 
                        regex e.g. pattern="[Bb]anana|[Cc]herry" will match lowercase or uppercase banana or cherry. 
                        textarea doesn't support this.</li>
                </ul>                
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>JavaScript Validation</strong></p>
                <p>For custom or more complex validation, can write javascript or use a JavaScript library to 
                    validate.  Most commonly used to change look and feel of the automatic error messages that
                    HTML gives when you try to submit an invalid form, as well as control message because 
                    message is locale-specific, i.e. it will be in french if the browser is set to french.</p>
                <p>There are libraries, the built in constraint validation API, or you can always write totally
                    custom js (usually you'd only do this if you need to support old browsers that don't support
                    the constraint validation API), the totally custom option would do everything like check for
                    all the user events, check the form values, test them against regexs in the js, check their length, etc.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Libraries: </strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>just-validate.js</strong> a simple vanilla JS library for validation</li>
                    <li><strong>parsley.js </strong> another JS library for validation</li>
                    <li><strong>formik.js</strong> validation library to be used with React, should look for 
                        framework-specific validation libraries
                        because they have to maniuplate the DOM and thus play well with the framework</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Constraint Validation API </strong>Most browser support this out of the box,
                    no library required. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This provides the following methods and properties on buttons, fieldsets, inputs, outputs, selects,
                        and textareas, which you can create references to in your JS with e.g. document.getElementById
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>.validationMessage: returns a string containing what if any validation constraints
                            are broken
                        </li>
                        <li>.validity.xxx: returns true or false if the element violates a validation rule or not,
                            e.g. .xxx could be .patternMismatch, returning true if the field violates a pattern rule,
                            .tooLong if it exceeds maxlength, .tooShort if it is less than minlength, 
                            .rangeOverflow if exceeds max, .rangeUnderflow if less than min,
                            .typeMismatch if violating a type rule, .valid to check if it meets all constraints,
                            and .valueMissing returns true if it's blank but required
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            .willValidate: returns true if the element will be valid when the form is submitted
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            .checkValidity(): returns true if the element is valid, and false if invalid plus
                            fires an invalid event on the element
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            .setCustomValidity(): takes a custom error message string as a argument, and displays
                            it for the element and also sets the element as invalid, allowing you to set it as invalid
                            depending on any custom code you write that leads to this method.  If the method has an
                            empty string as the argument, it will not display an error message and the element will be
                            set as valid.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>You may want to add the <code>novalidate</code> attribute to the form element to disable
                        the browser's automatic validation check, but will still allow the constraint validation 
                        api to work and the css pseudoclasses like :invalid.  This is often used to
                        prevent error popups in the browser, so that you can show a fully custom error message perhaps
                        somewhere else on the page like in a div.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Using this, you can check if things are invalid in your form's submit event,
                                then preventDefault to stop the form from being sent, and then run your own custom
                                code for the invalid values.  Your custom code can respond to different types of invalid
                                like rangeOverflow vs typeMismatch etc.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Simple Example: </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In your JS, first get DOM variables for whatever form inputs you want to control,
                            e.g. <code>email = document.getElementById('mail');</code> could get an input from your HTML
                            like <code>&ltinput type="email" id="mail" name="mail"></code>
                        </li>
                        <li>Then you can add an event listener for input, and check for e.g. a type mismatch. If
                            there is a type mismatch, then you can use setCustomValidity which will display a given
                            custom error message and set the input as invalid, or use setCustomValidity with an
                            empty string, rendering the input valid and displaying no error message.
                            <code><pre>
                            email.addEventListener("input", function (event) {
                                if (email.validity.typeMismatch) {
                                    email.setCustomValidity("I am expecting an e-mail address!");
                                } else {
                                    email.setCustomValidity("");
                                }
                            });
                            </pre></code>
                        </li>                        
                    </ul>

                </ul>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Server-side validation</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Regardless of client-side validation, a server should never trust the data it receives and must 
                always validate for security purposes, also often sanitizes data for consistent formatting</li>
            <li>Client side validation is easy to bypass (turn off javascript in the browser), or through middleman 
                attacks that alter data after client validation and before it reaches the server</li>
            <li>Server-side validation allows you to keep validation code hidden, more computing power, and can 
                access data in the database like checking for unique username</li>
            <li>Can be done as user is entering data input by input which can slow down user, or upon submission 
                of the form after all data is entered</li>
        </ul>
