    <h1>Database Design</h1>

    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Relational Databases model data by storing it in relations (tables), which contain tuples (rows), and tuples have attributes (columns).  Relations are usually visualized as tables.</li>
        <li>Each tuple should have a unique, non null primary key that identifies that tuple, a compound or composite key uses more than one column, and a simple key uses one column only. </li>
        <li>Referential Integrity is enforced through primary key/foreign key pairings in different relations.  The relations can be one-to-one which is often used for optional data about an entity and should be implemented by having a foreign key in the optional info table which is also constrained to be unique. There is also one-to-many which is a parent-child relationship and enforced with just a foreign key/primary key.  There is also many-to-many but this is always implemented as two one-to-many relationships and a junction/join table (often named after the two tables in the many to many relationship but with plural names instead of singular name of table, e.g. the person table and residence table could have a join table named <code>persons_residences</code>) that has foreign keys to both of the tables, and usually a composite primary key made up of the foreign keys so they are always a unique combination.</li>
        <li>Database schemas refer to the design of a particular database and are often visualized in a diagram that should at least contain all the table names, column names per table, data types per column, constraints per table, and relationships between tables.  Try <a href="http://dbdiagram.io/">DbDiagram.io</a>, <a href="http://sqldbm.com/home">SQL Database Modeler</a>, or <a href="http://dbdesigner.net/">DB Designer</a> for schema diagramming tools.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information Schema</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The SQL standard specifies an information schema which is a database containing meta information about a given database's tables, columns, constrains and other things, e.g. you can query the view <code>information_schema.key_column_usage</code> to get information on all primary keys, foreign keys and unique columns in the database.
        <code><pre>
            SELECT constraint_name, table_name, column_name
            FROM information_schema.key_column_usage
            WHERE table_name = 'recipe';
        </pre></code></li>
        <li>The information schema show the names of constraints, which for primary keys and foreign keys default to tablename_pkey or tablename_fkey (these will have a single entry if the table has just one primary key column, or multiple entries with the same constraint name for a table with a composite primary key). Unique columns get a default constraint name of tablename_key, and columns can have multiple separate constraints, e.g. one for foreign key and one for unique.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Normalization</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To get to third normal form: Every attribute depends on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key, so help me Codd.</li>
        <li><strong>First Normal Form (1NF): </strong> Simply means for each attribute of each tuple, the attribute is single-valued, not a list of values (unless the list is considered a single value). Generally a list means you need another relation that has a one-to-many relationship with the first. AKA atomic rule.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Normal Form (2NF): </strong>You've achieved 1NF, and every attribute value of every tuple is determined by the whole primary key.  Automatically achieved if you primary key is one column, but if it is multiple columns, you have to make sure the whole combination of primary key columns is needed to determine the attribute.  Not that some subset of the primary key is enough to determine the attribute.</li>
        <li><strong>Third Normal Form (3NF): </strong>You have 2NF, and each attribute cannot be determined by another attribute or combination of attributes that is not the primary key.</li>
    </ul>
