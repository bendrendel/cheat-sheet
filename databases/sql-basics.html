    <h1>SQL Basics</h1>

    <h2>Basic info</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Language designed to manage data stored in relational databases, implemented in slightly different ways depending on the RDBMS vendor.  Officially pronounced S-Q-L according to original ANSI/ISO standards definition.  But originally the language was named SEQUEL (Structured english query language, and a pun on a previous query language it sought to surpass named QUEL) and pronounced sequel and only changed to SQL due to a copyright issue of the name SEQUEL.  In Oracle documentation they say it is pronounced sequel, and microsoft's SQL Server is usually pronounced sequel server so you hear sequel more in those worlds, but in others like MySQL is pronounced my ess que ell.  Now SQL stands for Structured Query Language.</li>
        <li>ANSI/ISO/IEC jointly maintain offical SQL standards, or official standard SQL language, most RDBMSs do not implement the full SQL standard and vary from it in different ways.</li>
        <li>Data is stored in one or more tables, which is data organized into rows and columns of specified dat atypes.  Tables and columns are traditionally named in snake case - i.e. in all lowercase with underscores between words. Some prefer table names be plural and column names be singular.</li>
        <li>Rows store a single record of the data</li>
        <li>There is a special value NULL, that represents missing or unknown data.  The null value is tested in conditions with <code>column_name IS NULL</code> (instead of an equal sign)</li>
        <li>Stored Procedures are saved SQL statements to make them easy to re-run.</li>
        <li>Check out <a href="https://sqlzoo.net">SQL Zoo</a> for SQL practice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Statements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>SQL statements are commands sent to an RDBMS, always ending in a semicolon. Can be written all in one line or broken across multiple lines for readability</li>
        <li>Clauses (sometimes called commands) start a SQL statement, and are written in all caps, like SELECT or CREATE TABLE</li>
        <li>Following a clause is the name of a table, </li>
        <li>Parameters follow the table name and varies depending on the clause, but generally is a lost of column names, data types, values</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>CREATE Statements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The CREATE TABLE clause can make statements telling the database to make a new table and is given a table name, and parameters of the column names for the new table along with their data type and optionally one or more contraints on the column.  The UNIQUE clause can be added at the end if you need to specify that some combination of columns is unique, and FOREIGN KEY constraints are added at the end also e.g. 
            <code><pre>
                CREATE TABLE celebs (
                    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
                    name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL, 
                    age INTEGER CHECK (age > 0),
                    city_id INTEGER,
                    gender_id INTEGER REFERENCES gender(id),
                    date_of_birth NOT NULL,
                    date_of_death DEFAULT 'Not Applicable',
                    UNIQUE (name, age),
                    FOREIGN KEY (city_id) REFERENCES cities (id) ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE
                );
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>Data Types: Columns hold data of a specified type, these vary based on the RDBMS and aren't always interchangeable between RDBMSs.  Common ones are dates, strings, integers, and booleans.  Numeric values can either be signed or unsigned.</li>
        <li>Constraints make restrictions on column values, and if you attempt to execute a statement that breaks one of the constraints, you will get a constrain violation error and the statement will not be executed. These include:
            <ul>
                <li>PRIMARY KEY: each value in column must be unique and cannot be null, can be a single column or set of columns, that uniquely identifies each row, similar to implementing UNIQUE NOT NULL except only one primary key allowed per table, whereas as many columns may be UNIQUE NOT NULL, for single-column primary keys you put PRIMARY KEY after the column definition.  For multi-column composite primary keys, you should put a separate PRIMARY KEY entry after you define all the columns (similar to how UNIQUE is used in the example above), the entry would be PRIMARY KEY (column_name_1, column_name_2, ....)</li>
                <li>UNIQUE: each value in column must be unique, or can specify the combined value of two or more columns has to be unique by including a separate clause after the column definitions.  To implement a one-to-one foreign key relationship you should use UNIQUE on the foreign key column, like <code>foreign_id REFERENCES table_name(id) UNIQUE</code></li>
                <li>NOT NULL: each value in column cannot be NULL</li>
                <li>DEFAULT 'value': each value in column is given a specified default value if value is not specified otherwise</li>
                <li>CHECK (...): check constraints are provided a boolean condition that must be fulfilled by values in the column, e.g. CHECK (my_column > 0).  You can use SQL inside the condition, it can be anything you would include in a WHERE clause, like AND/OR/LIKE, e.g. CHECK (my_column > 0 AND my_column &lt 100) or CHECK (my_column LIKE "some text")</li>
                <li>FOREIGN KEY / REFERENCES: enforces referential integrity, meaning the value in a column with a foreign key constrain must be among the value in a specified column in another table (generally the primary key of that table). The foreign key column data type should be the same as the primary key it references. This can be added directly after the column definition using the REFERENCES keyword, as shown for the gender_id column above.  This can also be added after the column definitions, may be many Foreign Key columns and constraints. FOREIGN KEY (foreign_key_column_name) REFERENCES table_name (primary_key_column_name). You can specify ON DELETE RESTRICT or ON UPDATE RESTRICT, to ensure that if the referenced primary key row is attempted to be deleted or changed, it won't be allowed if there is a row referencing it as a foreign key.  This is the default behaviour in most RDBMSs so doesn't need to be included.  YOU can also specify ON DELETE CASCADE or ON UPDATE CASCADE, which means if the primary key row is deleted all rows referencing it will be deleted, or if the primary key is updated then all foreign keys will automatically update to the new primary key value.  You can also combine these like ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ALTER Statements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The ALTER TABLE...ADD/DROP COLUMN clause adds/drops columns to a specified table.  It is given the name of the table to add/drop the column to/from, and if adding, then the name of the new column and its data type an doptionally any constraints, or if dropping just the name of the column to drop.  Note if adding, existing rows will be given a NULL value for the new column.
            <code><pre>
                ALTER TABLE celebs 
                ADD COLUMN twitter_handle TEXT;
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>The ALTER TABLE...ALTER COLUMN...SET/DROP clause can alter column constraints for existing columns in existing tables. Adding a constraint using SET, and removing a constraint using DROP.  If adding the constraint will cause constraint violations to existing rows in the table then the statement will not execute.  For instance, if there are null values in a column and you try to add a not null constraint, the statement will be rejected, and if you want to do this, you need to first run an UPDATE statement to change all null values in the column to something that isn't null like 'N/A'.  e.g.
            <code><pre>
                ALTER TABLE talks
                ALTER COLUMN session_timeslot SET NOT NULL;
            </pre></code>
        or
            <code><pre>
                ALTER TABLE talks
                ALTER COLUMN session_timeslot DROP NOT NULL
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>The ALTER TABLE...ADD CONSTRAINT clause seems to be what you need to use for Postgres instead of the SET/DROP and ADD CHECK/ADD UNIQUE/etc statements below.  For example:
            <code><pre>
                ALTER TABLE films
                ADD CONSTRAINT unique_release UNIQUE (release_year);
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>The ALTER TABLE...ADD CHECK clause is used to add check constraints to existing columns in existing tables.  Note adding multiple check restraints or other constrainsts to a column requires multiple alter table statements. The condition can use AND/OR/LIKE "example value"/IN(value1, value2, value3), and can use multiple column names and add their values, compare their values, etc. e.g. 
            <code><pre>
                ALTER TABLE talks 
                ADD CHECK (estimate_length &lt available_time);
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>The ALTER TABLE...ADD UNIQUE clause is an alternative way of adding a UNIQUE constrain to an existing column of an exisiting table, you give it the name of a table and a column, or you can give it two or more columns to specify the combination of those columns must be unique e.g. 
            <code><pre>
                ALTER TABLE attendees 
                ADD UNIQUE (name, city);
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>The ALTER TABLE...ADD PRIMARY KEY clause is an alternative way of adding a PRIMARY KEY contraint to an existing column of an existing table, e.g. 
            <code><pre>
                ALTER TABLE attendees
                ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>The ALTER TABLE...ADD FOREIGN KEY...REFERENCES clause lets you add foreign key constraints to an existing table and column, include ON DELETE/ON UPDATE Specifications e.g. 
            <code><pre>
                ALTER TABLE registrations
                ADD FOREIGN KEY (talk_id)
                REFERENCES talks (id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
            </pre></code>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>INSERT Statements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The INSERT INTO...VALUES clause is used to add rows to a table.  It is given a table name and list of columns to insert data into, then a list of values to insert into those columns.  If you're inserting into all the columns, then you can leave out the column names to insert into and just have the table name.  This will insert the provided values starting at the first column and inserting sequentially after that e.g.
            <code><pre>
                INSERT INTO celebs (id, name, age) 
                VALUES (1, 'Justin Bieber', 22);
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>There is also a COPY statement that allows you to copy data from a flat file into a table (named weather below) like so:
            <code><pre>
                COPY weather FROM '/home/user/weather.txt';
            </pre></code>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>UPDATE Statements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The UPDATE...SET...WHERE clause will edit an existing row or rows in an existing table.  It takes the table name where the row(s) exists.  A column name to edit with the new value for that column, and finally a condition that determines which row(s) will be edited (all rows that meet the condition)e.g.
            <code><pre>
                UPDATE celebs 
                SET twitter_handle = '@taylorswift13' 
                WHERE id = 4; 
            </pre></code>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>DELETE Statements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The DELETE FROM...WHERE clause will delete existing rows from an existing table.  It takes the name of a table from where rows will be delete, and then a condition that determines which rows to delete (all rows that meet the condition) e.g.
            <code><pre>
                DELETE FROM celebs 
                WHERE twitter_handle IS NULL;
            </pre></code>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>SELECT statement</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The SELECT ... FROM clause is used to retrieve data from the database, called a query.  This statement actual returns data in the form of a table, called the result set. It is given one or more columns separated by commas to get data from (or * to select all columns from a table), and then a table name that those columns appear in. e.g.
            <code><pre>
                SELECT name, age 
                FROM celebs;
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>SELECT queries support many different additional clauses (below).  You add clauses in a specific order to your code but that is not necessarily the order in which they are executed.  The RDBMS will optimize your code before running for performance, but logically, the clauses are executed in this order by the RDBMS:
            <ol>
                <li>FROM/JOIN and all the ON conditions</li>
                <li>WHERE</li>
                <li>GROUP BY</li>
                <li>HAVING</li>
                <li>SELECT (including window functions)</li>
                <li>ORDER BY</li>
                <li>LIMIT</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The DISTINCT clause can be used to remove duplicate rows from the output.
            <code><pre>
                SELECT DISTINCT tools 
                FROM inventory;
            </pre></code>
        </li>        
        <li>The AS clause can be used to rename a column or table in the output.  For tables at least, you can also include an alias immediately after the table with no AS clause.
            <code><pre>
                SELECT name AS 'Titles'
                FROM movies;
            </pre></code>
            or
            <code><pre>
                SELECT m.name, s.starttime
                FROM movies m
                JOIN showtimes s
                 ON m.id = s.movie_id;
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>The CASE WHEN...THEN...ELSE...END clause can be used to make custom columns within the query. The ELSE is optional.  You can optionally add the AS clause as well to name your custom column. e.g.
            <code><pre>
                SELECT name,
                    CASE
                        WHEN imdb_rating > 8 THEN 'Fantastic'
                        WHEN imdb_rating > 6 THEN 'Poorly Received'
                        ELSE 'Avoid at All Costs'
                    END AS 'Review'
                FROM movies;
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>Aggregate Functions can be used instead of column names or custom case columns, allowing you to perform calculations on the returned results instead of displaying the results themselves.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>COUNT(column or columns) will return the total number of records in the result set.  You can nest DISTINCT inside COUNT to only count number of unique values in column like COUNT(DISTINCT column name), e.g. 
                <code><pre>
                    SELECT COUNT(*)
                    FROM fake_apps
                    WHERE price = 0;
                </pre></code>
            </li>
            <li>SUM(column) will return the sum of all values in the provided column, e.g. 
                <code><pre>
                    SELECT SUM(downloads)
                    FROM fake_apps;
                </pre></code>
            </li>
            <li>MAX(column)/MIN(column) will return the highest or lowest value in the provided column, e.g. 
                <code><pre>
                    SELECT MAX(downloads)
                    FROM fake_apps;
                </pre></code>
            </li>
            <li>AVG(column) will return the average of the values in the provided column, e.g. 
                <code><pre>
                    SELECT AVG(price)
                    FROM fake_apps;
                </pre></code>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>ROUND(column or aggregate expression, #) isn't will round all values in a column to the given # of decimal places (no aggregation), or it can be given an aggregate expression and it will round the result of it e.g. 
            <code><pre>
                SELECT name, ROUND(price, 0)
                FROM fake_apps;
            </pre></code>
            or
            <code><pre>
                SELECT ROUND(AVG(price), 2)
                FROM fake_apps;
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>The JOIN...ON clause allows us to combine information from multiple tables in the result set, based on primarykey/foreign key relationships. JOIN performs an inner join (you can equivalently use the clause INNER JOIN for the same thing as JOIN), that is any rows in either table that don't have a matching row in the other based on the ON condition are excluded.  You can use the clause LEFT JOIN to keep any unmatched rows in the table listed after the FROM clause.  This is useful for finding all unmatched pairs in the left table by performing a left join and then filtering to just rows that had a null value for the right table id.  The CROSS JOIN clause will combine each row from one table with each row from another, and doesn't take an ON condition. You can also put multiple JOIN statements one after the other to join multiple tables together.  e.g. 
            <code><pre>
                SELECT orders.order_id,
                    customers.customer_name
                FROM orders
                JOIN customers
                    ON orders.customer_id = customers.id;
            </pre></code>
            or
            <code><pre>
                SELECT *
                FROM newspaper
                LEFT JOIN online
                    ON newspaper.id = online.id
                WHERE online.id IS NULL;
            </pre></code>
            or
            <code><pre>
                SELECT month, COUNT(*)
                FROM newspaper
                CROSS JOIN months
                WHERE start_month &lt= month
                    AND end_month >= month
                GROUP BY month;
            </pre></code>
            <code><pre>
                SELECT book.title AS book_title, chapter.title AS chapter_title, page.content AS page_content
                FROM book
                INNER JOIN chapter
                    ON book.isbn = chapter.book_isbn
                INNER JOIN page
                    ON chapter.id = page.chapter_id;
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>The WHERE clause can be used to add conditions that rows must meet in order to be included in the output set.  The WHERE clause is given a boolean condition which can use things SQL calls operators.
        <ul>
            <li>These include =, !=, >, &lt, >=, and &lt=. These compare numbers but can also be used intuitively with dates, e.g. <code>timestamp > '2020-09-01'</code> would select all timestamp values after Sept 1, 2020.</li>
            <li>You can also use <code>column_name LIKE 'somestring'</code>, which will only return rows where column_name matches the pattern in single quotes (not case-sensitive).  You can include an underscore as a wildcard for a single character, or a percent sign as a wildcard for 0 or more characters. </li>
            <li>The IN clause can be used to test if a value is in a list of provided values, e.g. <code>column_name IN (value1, value2, value3)</code></li>
            <li>To test for nulls you can't use =/!= but rather use column_name IS NULL or column_name IS NOT NULL.</li>
            <li>BETWEEN...AND can be used for an inclusive between (includes values matching both ends) like <code>column_name BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000</code> or <code>column_name BETWEEN 'A' AND 'J'</code>, note when using text like this, all values starting with A are included, but values starting with 'J' are not unless the value is just 'J', because 'Ja' for instance comes after 'J'</li>
            <li>AND can be used to combine multiple conditions that must all be met, and OR can be used to combine multiple conditions where any one must be met.</li>
        </ul>      
            <code><pre>
                SELECT name AS title
                FROM movies
                WHERE director LIKE '%spielberg'
                    AND genre = 'horror'
                    AND year BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>The GROUP BY clause comes after any WHERE statements, and before any ORDER BY or LIMIT statements. It can be used to collapse the results into groups based on the values in a particular column or set of columns.  Can group on multiple columns, separated by commas. All columns that are not being grouped must be an aggregate function. GROUP BY can be given column names, alias names, or numbers referring to the column number to group on (in order of how they are written in the select statement).  You can group on e.g. 
            <code><pre>
                SELECT year,
                    AVG(imdb_rating)
                FROM movies
                GROUP BY year
                ORDER BY year;
            </pre></code>
            or
            <code><pre>
                SELECT category,
                    price,
                    AVG(downloads)
                FROM fake_apps
                GROUP BY 1, 2;
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>The HAVING clause comes after GROUP BY and before ORDER BY.  It is used to filter results after grouping takes place, and can take all the same types of conditions a WHERE clause can.  e.g. 
            <code><pre>
                SELECT price,
                    ROUND(AVG(downloads)),
                    COUNT(*)
                FROM fake_apps
                GROUP BY price
                HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>The ORDER BY...ASC/DESC clause can be added (always after the WHERE clause if present) to order the results by a given column (which doesn't have to be among columns returned).  The ASC keyword sorts results ascending (alphabetically or numerically) and DESC sorts them descending, ASC is defualt if not included, ORDER BY like GROUP BY also accepts column numbers to refer to the column number to order on based on the order in which the are written after the SELECT clause, e.g.
            <code><pre>
                SELECT *
                FROM movies
                WHERE imdb_rating > 8
                ORDER BY year DESC;
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>The LIMIT clause can be added to only show a given number of rows in the output, and always goes at the end of the query (after WHERE and ORDER BY) e.g.
            <code><pre>
                SELECT name, age 
                FROM celebs
                LIMIT 10;                
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>The UNION clause can stack the results of two separate SELECT statements on top of each other, the two statements must have the same number of columns and same data type in each respective column. You may need to put each SELECT statement in parentheses if they contain LIMIT, ORDER BY or other clauses.  UNION is also handy for making a mini data set out of thin air, where each SELECT statement is only a single line with no FROM clause and defines a single row of the table you want to make with a value and column name, then you stack the rows together with UNION e.g. 
            <code><pre>
                SELECT *
                FROM table1
                UNION
                SELECT *
                FROM table2;
            </pre></code>
            or
            <code><pre>
                SELECT '2017-01-01' as month
                UNION
                SELECT '2017-02-01' as month
                UNION
                SELECT '2017-03-01' as month;
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>The WITH...AS clause can be used with SELECT statements to give the results of a SELECT statement an alias that can be used in later code, you can define multiple queries with a single WITH clause separated by commas, there is no comma after the final query (or only query if just one), no semicolon until the very end, e.g. 
            <code><pre>
                WITH previous_results AS (
                    SELECT ...
                    ...
                    ...
                    ...
                ),
                other_results AS (
                    SELECT ...
                )
                SELECT *
                FROM previous_results
                JOIN customers
                ON _____ = _____;
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>Nested SELECT statements can be used, called subqueries, in different places of a SELECT statement, always contained within parentheses.  They can be used in the FROM clause to define a table that the SELECT query operates on, using another SELECT query and in this case you can and generally should name the sub query by putting a name directly after it.  They can also be used in the WHERE clause to define conditions, if the subquery returns a single value, you can test if something is equal to that value, if the subquery returns a single column with multiple values, you can test if something is IN that list of values. You can also include a subquery in a JOIN clause, again with the option to give that subquery a name directly after it.  e.g. 
            <code><pre>
                SELECT LEFT(sub.date, 2) AS cleaned_month,
                    sub.day_of_week,
                    AVG(sub.incidents) AS average_incidents
                FROM (
                        SELECT day_of_week,
                            date,
                            COUNT(incidnt_num) AS incidents
                        FROM tutorial.sf_crime_incidents_2014_01
                        GROUP BY 1,2
                    ) sub
                GROUP BY 1,2
                ORDER BY 1,2;
            </pre></code>
            or
            <code><pre>
                SELECT *
                FROM tutorial.sf_crime_incidents_2014_01
                WHERE Date IN (SELECT date
                                FROM tutorial.sf_crime_incidents_2014_01
                                ORDER BY date
                                LIMIT 5
                            );
            </pre></code>
            or
            <code><pre>
                SELECT *
                FROM tutorial.sf_crime_incidents_2014_01 incidents
                JOIN ( SELECT date
                        FROM tutorial.sf_crime_incidents_2014_01
                        ORDER BY date
                        LIMIT 5
                    ) sub
                    ON incidents.date = sub.date
            </pre></code>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The CREATE VIEW Statement</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The CREATE VIEW statement is a way to save a query to a persistent name that can then be referenced in other queries.  Views should be used liberally to create persistent helpful views of the data even as the database design changes. Views can be built upon other views, and can be used almost anywhere a real table can. e.g. 
            <code><pre>
                CREATE VIEW myview AS
                    SELECT name, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date, location
                        FROM weather, cities
                        WHERE city = name;

                SELECT * FROM myview;
            </pre></code>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Transaction Statements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Transactions allow you to group multiple SQL statements which will run together.  They are opened with BEGIN and closed with COMMIT and between contain a series of statements called the transaction block.  No one else using the database will be able to see the intermediate states of running each line in the transaction.  The end result of running all of the statements will become visible at the completion of the transaction.  If there is an error at any statement, then no changes will be made to the database even for statements in the transaction prior to the error.  You can use ROLLBACK to cancel the transaction manually, and you can use SAVEPOINTS if you want ROLLBACK to cancel just a certain part of the transaction.  Many databases implicity wrap every statement inside a transaction.
            <code><pre>
                BEGIN;
                UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00
                    WHERE name = 'Alice';
                SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
                UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00
                    WHERE name = 'Bob';
                -- oops ... forget that and use Wally's account
                ROLLBACK TO my_savepoint;
                UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00
                    WHERE name = 'Wally';
                COMMIT;
            </pre></code>
        </li>
    </ul>
