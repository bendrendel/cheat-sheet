    <h1>Database Basics</h1>
    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Database refers to the actual dataset, Database Management System (DBMS) is the software that allows you to interact with and access databases. Database System generally refers as a whole to a particular Database, the DBMS, and the theoretical model of data used to organize the data.  DBMSs generally use the relational model to organize data and are called Relational DBMSs (RDBMSs) and use an implementation of the SQL language to manage the data.  Programmers often map database records into objects, e.g. a Person record would be an object representing that person with their attributes as keys.  Object-relational databases and Object-Relational Mappings attempt to make this translation easy. In the late 2000s, non-relational models have become more common and are sometimes called NoSQL databases, used more often for machine learning applications, internet of things, and web analytics.  RDBMS still dominates however.</li>
        <li>DBMSs generally provide four main functions: Data definition (defining the organization of data in the database, using a Data Definition Language or DDL), Update (Inserting, modifying, deleting data, using a Data Manipulation Language or DML), Retrieval (getting data out of the database in useful forms, using a Data Query Langauge or DQL), Administration (user management, security, performance, integrity, concurrency, recovery, using a Data Control Language or DCL)</li>
        <li>Database servers are machines dedicated to just storing a database and running a DBMS and related software, increases security.  Most RDBMSs are designed to run as a server process, expecting applications to interact with it as a server process.</li>
        <li>Data integrity is a term used in different ways, but it generally means preventing unintentional changes to information, i.e. input is recorded as intended, and output is exactly the same as the original recording.  Physical data integrity refers to physical storage and retrieval of information.  Logical integrity refers correctness/rationality of information in a given context.  In a database context the DBMS maintains logical data integrity by enforcing entity integrity (every entity has a primary key), referential integrity (foreign keys always reference an existing primary key), domain integrity (every attribute value comes from a specified domain of values), user-defined integrity (other integrity constrains designed by the user).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>CRUD</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>APIs for managing a persistent data storage system (generally a database) should fundamentally provide distinct Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) mechanisms for that data - nothing more, nothing less.</li>
        <li>In a REST environment, CRUD usually corresponds to the HTTP methods POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CREATE/POST:</strong> POST is used to create a new resource in a resource collection.  Generally, you send a POST request to a specific a collection like <code>http://www.myrestaurant.com/dishes/</code> with a body containing an object representing the new resources.  The server should send back a 201 (CREATED) code along with a link to the newly created resource. e.g. The request body would contain the object below, and the response would send this object back but with an id property as well:
            <code><pre>
                {
                    "dish": {
                        "name": “Avocado Toast”,
                        "price": 8
                    }
                }
            </pre></code></li>
            <li><strong>READ/GET:</strong> GET is used to read a whole collection of resources or a single resource, e.g. either <code>http://www.myrestaurant.com/dishes</code> or <code>http://www.myrestaurant.com/dishes/1223</code>.  The response should send back a 200 (OK) code along with either an array of objects representing each resource in a collection, or a single object representing a single resource. 404 (NOT FOUND) should be sent on error. e.g. response body of requesting a collection: 
            <code><pre>
                {
                    "dishes": [
                        {
                            "id": 1,
                            "name": “Spring Rolls”,
                            "price": 6
                        },
                        {
                            "id": 2,
                            "name": “Mozzarella Sticks”,
                            "price": 7
                        },
                        ...
                        {
                            "id": 1223,
                            "name": “Avocado Toast”,
                            "price": 8
                        },
                        {
                            "id": 1224,
                            "name": “Muesli and Yogurt”,
                            "price": 5
                        }
                    ]
                }
            </pre></code></li>
            <li><strong>UPDATE/PUT:</strong> PUT is used to update a specific resource. So it would be sent to a specific resource e.g. <code>http://www.myrestaurant.com/dishes/1223</code>. It would contain a body like the one used for the POST request, with the new values for that resource.  The response should return status code 200 (OK), with a body of the updated object, just like the POST request.  You might return 204 (NO CONTENT) depending on circumstances</li>
            <li><strong>DELETE/DELETE:</strong> DELETE is used to remove a specific resource. So it would be sent to a specific resource e.g. <code>http://www.myrestaurant.com/dishes/1223</code>. The response should send back the 204 (NO CONTENT) code, with no body.  If you try to delete something that doesn't exist you should get a 404 (NOT FOUND) error code returned.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Popular RDBMSs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>RDBMSs can differ, most use SQL but have their own implementation of it with different limitations and extensions of the language, most do not support the whole SQL standard defined by ANSI/ISO. Data types may differ, and accessing built-in tables like the list of indexes will differ.</li>
        <li><strong>SQLite</strong> Free and open source, no special license needed.  Can pay for compression and encryption features or commercial support.  Can store whole database in one file making it easily portable and can store locally instead of using a server.  Any process that accesses the database reads and writes to the disk files directly instead of through a server like most databases are designed for.  This makes it easy to configure since no server configuration is needed and processes interacting with it simply need access to the disk instead of a server.  Often used in cellphones, PDAs, set top boxes, MP3 Players, things like that, good for embedded applications, can serve as a replacement for programs that need to read/write to disk a lot - they could use SQLite instead for SQL benefits, also good for testing in place of a server side database.  Shouldn't be used for databases bigger than 1TB, or applications with high volume of write operations/lots of concurrent users, or if network access is needed (i.e. you want to be able to have programs access it across a network). File extension is .sqlite.  Main advantages are that it's lightweight, self-contained (no other dependencies need to be installed), quick setup (serverless), portability (single file can be shared).  Disadvantages are limited concurrency (allows multiple processes to access at one time, but only one change at a time unlike client/server databases like MySQL and postgres), no user management (no roles, different levels of access etc), not as secure as server solutions that keep client bugs separated from server.</li>
        <li><strong>MySQL</strong>Most popular open source RDBMS, with a free version, and several paid versions that offer various additional features and plugins for commercial use.  Typically used for web development and accessed using PHP and can support growth including easy move to paid versions.  Used by Twitter, Facebook, Netflix, and Spotify.  Been around a long time, good community and help resources, reliable, lots of third party extensions for more functionality and database admins who know how to use it well.  Has security and user management features (grant access on user-by-user basis).  Reputation for being one of the fatest performing databases available. However, suffers with high volume of concurrent write operations in which you may need to move up to Postgres or something else.  Has features for replication used to make backups or to scale horizontally.  Lacks some suprising SQL features like FULL JOIN.  Less open source development since Oracle took control of it. Good for distributed solutions,  </li>
        <li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> AKA Postgres (pronunce post-grehs). Powerful, open source ORDBMS (Object-relational) typically used for web development. Easy to use, reliable, has some more advanced features than MySQL, but can be slower performance than MySQL and not as popular and not as many database admins know it compared to MySQL, but still has a range of third party libraries to expand functionality and good community and help resources.  Handles high concurrency well for lots of concurrent write operations, using Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC) and ensures full ACID compliance, however this can cause slower performance so it's not usually a better choice than MySQL for simple read-heavy operations.  Although for complex data-warehousing operations or online transaction processing, Postgres is great as it support multi-CPU processing of comples operations.  30 years of active development (came from INGRES one of the original RDBMSs). Adheres more closely to SQL standard than MySQL and SQLite, which can be overkill for simple read-heavy operations where MySQL might be better choice.  Replicaiton features aren't gneerally as good or easy to use as MySQL.  Integrates well with many different programming languages and platforms so good if you may need to migrate. Files extension is .sql</li>
        <li><strong>Oracle DB</strong> Owned by Oracle, not open source, made for large applications, especially in banking industry where it has many built in applications for that.</li>
        <li><strong>SQL Server</strong> Owned by Microsoft, not open source, used for enterprise applications mostly, there is a free version called Express, but gets expensive as you scale up</li>
