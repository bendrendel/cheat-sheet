    <h2>Popular RDBMSs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>RDBMSs can differ, though they use a mostly standard SQL syntax to access data.  Data types may differ, and accessing built-in tables like the list of indexes will differ.</li>
        <li><strong>MySQL</strong> Most popular open source RDBMS, typically used for web development and accessed using PHP.  Been around a long time, good community, reliable, but not good for scaling up, and not as many advanced features.  Less open source development since Oracle took control of it</li>
        <li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> Open source RDBMS typically used for web development. Easy to use, reliable, has some more advanced features than MySQL, but can be slower performance than MySQL and not as popular. Files extension is .sql</li>
        <li><strong>Oracle DB</strong> Owned by Oracle, not open source, made for large applications, especially in banking industry where it has many built in applications for that.</li>
        <li><strong>SQL Server</strong> Owned by Microsoft, used for enterprise applications mostly, there is a free version called Express, but gets expensive as you scale up</li>
        <li><strong>SQLite</strong> Open source, can store whole database in one file and can store locally instead of using a server.  Often used in cellphones, PDAs, set top boxes, MP3 Players, things like that. File extension is .sqlite</li>
    </ul>
