    <h1>Build Tools</h1>
    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Build tools fall into 3 major categories: package managers to use libraries (like npm and yarn), bundlers to efficiently combine your files for delivery (like webpack, esbuild, Parcel, Vite), and task runners to automate repetitive workflow tasks (like grunt and gulp).</li>
        <li>App production has three major phases: development, testing, and deployment, and build tools can help with all stages.</li>
        <li>Task Runners are for automation, for example, your task runner with one command could optimize images, convert typescript to js, convert scss to css, etc.</li>
        <li> Bundlers at their core bundle multiple source files into a single file called a chunk - they take all the files of your source code (multiple js modules, css files, html files, images, etc.) and combine them into a single file like index.bundle.js.  To do this, a bundler is going to create a dependency graph of your source code, a directed graph data structure, that shows e.g. index.js depends on index.css and user.js, and in turn index.css depends on font.woff and user.js depends on banner.png, etc.  This is necessary for the bundler to understand how to best combine all the files.  Also, in the process the bundler can do different things to optimize your code to basically make it run as fast as possible for the client.  These techniques include code-splitting which creates more than one bundled file so that code can be loaded by the client on an as-needed basis, minification which removes whitespace/comments/replaces variable names with smaller names/etc to make the files as small as possible, dead-code elimination to remove any unused code and which may include tree-shaking which is a type of dead-code elimination that searches included modules for files and functions that aren't used.</li>
        <li>Build tools strictly speaking are optional since js is directly interpreted by the browser, its not like a language that requires compiling first.</li>
        <li>Early build tools simply concatenated all your scripts together, but it has gotten more complex since then with all the big libraries and advanced javascript ui.  The basic technique is to defer loading until needed instead of all at once.</li>
        <li>Before node and npm came to dominance, it was difficult to consume dependencies (it required script tags to CDNs that hosted the library in your html).  A major motivation of build tools was a sane way to use code libraries.</li>
        <li>With modules now standardized in JS, browsers are trying to create native support so build tools are needed for that any more.  but build tools do so much else now that they are probably here to stay.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Linters</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Linters are tools that scan source code for potential issues like syntax errors, faulty code structures (e.g. unnecessarily long methods or duplicated code), stylistic inconsistencies, and security.  Popular ones are ESLint, JSHint, and Stylelint for CSS.</li>
        <li>Linters are not a build tool strictly speaking.  Generally, linting occurs in real time as you write your code, whereas build tools are applied after code is written and you want to preview or deploy your app.  However some build tools like webpack do include linting as part of their build process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Updating Libraries</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>JS projects often end up using lots of third party libraries compared to other languages, this is due to node's intentionally small standard library, the fact that libraries often have many dependencies themselves, and a habit of keeping libraries single-task focused in node.</li>
        <li>Dependencies need to be kept up to date if you are using them in your project, so that you get the latest patches for security issues, bug fixes, performance improvements, etc.</li>
        <li>It is best to update often so that changes stay more minor than if you have to update after a long time, which could force you to make more changes to your code, problems with other dependencies, having to learn and make updates at an inconvenient time</li>
        <li>Library authors should be periodically updating the package.json of the library to include updated dependencies for that library, that way when you update the library you will get updated dependencies as well.</li>
        <li>All that said, there is a school of thought that you should only update dependencies if you have a specific reason to do so, because updates can introduce new bugs, regressions, and take time away from working on your own code and features.</li>
        <li>Semantic versioning (semver) is followed for node libraries, but authors may not always use it perfectly.  This is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning.  Major is when there is a breaking change to your code, meaning your API changes and people may need to change their code to keep using your project.  Minor is new functionality that is still backwards-compatible. Patches are bug-fixes that are backwards-compatible.</li>
        <li>Your package.json will by default include a ^ in front of the version number to indicate you will accept minor and patch updates, but not major updates.  e.g. in your dependencies property you may see <code>"lodash": "^3.1.0"</code></li>
        <li>You can run <code>npm outdated</code> to check what dependencies are out of date.</li>
        <li>You can run <code>npm update</code> to update all packages to the highest version that is indicated to be okay in your package.json (following the ^ notation) or <code>npm update lodash</code> or whatever library to just update that library.</li>
        <li>To update to the latest and ignore the "^" in your package.json, you will need to run <code>npm install lodash@latest</code> or whatever library name you want.</li>
        <li>You can run <code>npm-check</code> or <code>npm-check-updates</code> to get an interactive updating interface, which is good for updating lots of dependencies at once.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Task Runners (Scripting)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Task Runners can run multiple scripts for different purposes, e.g. creating a production build, minifying your file, or runnign tests, converting scss to css, changing all image paths to use a third party image hosting service.  They are generally good because they can run cross-platform.  They came about in web development as an alternative to getting libraries from different CDNs, you could download the code and then concatenate all the code together into a bundled js file or multiple bundles.</li>
        <li>Make: this is an old and well known task runner mostly used with C projects, but can be used with javascript. </li>
        <li>npm scripts: thanks to the package.json scripts property, npm CLI commands can be used as task runners.  You can define multiple scripts in the scripts property as one word commands that run some longer command.  Then they can be run with <code>npm run scriptname</code></li>
        <li>Grunt: this was the first famous task runner for web frontends.  It had many plugins which allowed you to define many smaller tasks, and you could run them within a watch task that would give you realtime error messages and warning as you change your code</li>
        <li>Gulp: This is common tool that doesn't rely on plugins like grunt does, and lets you write more actual code which is good especially if you're familiar with unix piping/file commands.</li>
        <li>Script Loaders: Before ES2015 import syntax, RequireJS was a popular library to export/import js modules.  JSPM is another approach.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Automation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Automation tools like CircleC, Travis, and Jenkins can run tests for your automatically, run all your build scripts</li>
        <li>Continuious Integration is offered by Github running build scripts, and Netlify runnign build scripts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Transpilation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tools like babel allowed developers to use new javascript syntax that browser weren't updated for yet, it would transpile code to older syntax.  This could be done on its own but often is used within the bundler and part of the bundler step.</li>
        <li>ONe issue is if you should only transpile your own code, or also your dependency code.  If you don't transpile dependency code, it could crash browsers, but if you do, it could lead to large files and slow down ux.  lately its shifted toward transpiling all code including dependencies.</li>
        <li>This also allows for non-standard javascript, like jsx in React, or single file components in other frameworks, that all get transpiled into real javascript, html, and css files to deliver to the browser.  It also opened the door to writing in any language you want and transpiling to js.  Typescript is currently the most popular.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bundlers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Module Bundling: Bundle is another term for build, often emphasizing the module bundling aspect of a build tool like webpack.  Bundling it the process of taking multiple js and css files, and concatenating them into one or more chunks. It is good to have multiple smaller chunks instead of one big file, to make loading and lookup faster.  This operates on a lower level than task runners, on modules and assets.  These started to replace task runners somewhat since things like npm scripts offered simple task running duties, and offered much more robust combining of javascript modules and libraries.  Task runners would simply concatenate and cause possible namespace issues, bad ordering, etc, all of which a bundler handles.  webpack pioneered the import syntax and allowed for import of css files and image files into javascript as well.  </li>
        <li>Browersify is a viable alternative to webpack. Brunch is another one.  Rollup is well known for its tree-shaking features and works with webpack.  Webpack is the big one, it offers a lot of power though complex to start with.  It is extenable with plugins and loaders.  create-react-app, Next.js, gatsby were built around webpack to simplify webpack usage.</li>
        <li>Bundlers usually do other things too, not fundamental to bundling, though:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Minification: This removes all white space from your file, sometimes called uglification.  It is not easily read by humans, but is easily read by robots still and reduces size.  It also removes all comments and reduces variable names.  There are tools to 'prettify' uglified files, adding whitespace back so you can read it.</li>
            <li>Code-splitting: this is what chunks up the bundle to minimize initial load, and later load as needed.</li>
            <li>Prerendering/server side rendering: renders html files on the server for initial load, so rendering doesn't have to take place on client.</li>
            <li>Deduplication: Finds duplicated libraries and removes them.</li>
            <li>Tree shaking:  This finds unused code in your files, variables that are defined but never used, unused functionality in libraries you're using, and it comments them out.  Since minification removes comments this will delete unused code from your files, reducing size.  You can turn it on just for libraries so e.g. you don't ship all the lodash functions, just the ones you use.</li>
            <li>Dev server</li>
            <li>Hot module replacement: if running dev server, constantly updating if code changes</li>
            <li>source maps: maps unreadable production code to source code for finding erros in production, etc.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
