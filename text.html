        <h2>Headings and Lists</h2>
        <p>Heading tags should create a heirarchical outline of content, without skipping levels.
            This helps to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create clear visual contrast to help users navigate</li>
            <li>Provide info to browsers, plugins, screen readers, assistive tech on how page
                is structured</li>
            <li>Helps with SEO in that keywords in the h1 tag will be weighted more heavily in
                search results</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Strive to be concise and break things into headings and lists wherever possible</p>
        <p>Headings should have more space above them than below to clearly connect them to their content, 
            equidistant spacing doesn't provide this</p>
        <ul>
            <li>h1 tags are for titles, should define purpose of page, and should be only one per page</li>
            <li>h2 tags are for headings to identify major sections that the user will be drawn toward</li>
            <li>h3 tags are for subheadings to identify smaller focal points like articles that the user 
                will notice when scanning</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Fonts</h2>
        <a href="https://www.reliablepsd.com/ultimate-google-font-pairings/">Google Font Pairings</a>
        <p>Use real text as opposed to images of text, which can't be understood by screen-readers,
            can't be magnified as well, and are more taxing to load</p>
        <p>Often effective for the page title to have its own font, and perhaps certain subheaders have a 
            third font</p>
        <p>Generally effective for most text to be in a serif font, and headings or subheadings in a 
            complementary sans-serif font, but this varies</p>
        <p>Only use 2-3 typefaces per page, and find other sources of visual contrast beside typeface if 
            you feel the need for more than 3</p>
        <p>Also create contrast between different pieces of text with style, size, weight, color, and case</p>
        <p>Ensure fonts are large enough (usually at least 16px) and have sufficient contrast between 
            foreground and background</p>
        <p>Always avoid blue fonts if it is not a link because it will confuse users trying to click on it 
            thinking its a link</p>
        
        <h2>Whitespace and Spacing</h2>
        <p><strong>Whitespace: </strong>Give each block of text its own space with sufficient whitespace 
            around text and other elements, 
            like a room it shouldn't be cluttered, titles shouldn't crowd subtitles, paragraphs shouldn't 
            crowd images, etc.</p>        
        <p><strong>Leading: </strong>Space between lines, make sure there is enough space between lines to 
            promote legibility.  alter with css line-height property.</p>
        <p><strong>Tracking: </strong>Space between the letters and the words applied consistently across 
            whole block of text.  Alter with css letter-spacing property. Too little tracking will make words 
            appear cramped, increase to make more legibile</p>
        <p><strong>Kerning: </strong>Space between specific letters in text as opposed to across whole block 
            of text, should be set by font designer and you don't normally worry about it. May want to tweak 
            specific spacing of letters in a title</p>

        <h2>Scanning</h2>
        <p><strong>Conciseness: </strong>Average internet paragraphs are only 1-3 sentences.  Users will skip 
            past long text blocks.  Avoid sentences and paragraphs if a list could be used or if use could 
            click through to details if desired</p>        
        <p><strong>F-Shaped Skimming: </strong>Users scan left side of screen before right, and top before 
            bottom, users jump back to left side of screen after finishing a line of text.  Cater to this 
            pattern, e.g. right-aligned text is likely to be skipped over</p>
        <p><strong>Line Length: </strong>Ideal line length is 50-75 characters, between users feeling too 
            frequently interuppted by line breaks and positive feeling of making progress with each new line</p>
        <p><strong>Columns: </strong>Sometimes columns are an effective way to keep line lengths short enough.  
            Columns tend to make users not travel across screen but rather keep going down.</p>
        <p><strong>Primacy and Recency: </strong>Users are most likely to notice and remember the first and 
            last elements of a list or page, which should be considered in placing content you want users 
            to remember</p>
        <p><strong>Image Pairing: </strong>Users are drawn to images, so you can pair text with an image 
            (like a card) to draw them to the text, but you don't want image to overshadow text completely</p>
