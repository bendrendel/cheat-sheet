    <h1>Descriptive Statistics</h1>

    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Variables</strong> Most data sets can be represented as a table, where each row is called an observation, and each column is called a variable.  Each cell contains a value.  Variables generally are either quantitative or categorical.</li>
        <li><strong>Quantitative Variables</strong> Quantitative variables are information about an observation that can only be described by numbers, usually counts or measurements of something.  They are well suited to mathematical analysis.  They are generally either discrete or continuous.  Sometimes something like age might be discrete or continuous, if it is the nearest age in years it is discrete, but if it age in years with a decimal representing fractions of a year then it is continuous.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Discrete Quantitative Variables</strong> These are variables that can only have integer values and represent counts of things, such as number of children in a family, or number of coin flips made</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Quantitative Variables</strong> These are variables that generally represent measurements like length, weight and age that theoretically can take on any real number.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Categorical Variables</strong> These variable group together or classify the observations and can either be ordinal if they have an order, or nominal if not.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ordinal Categorical Variables</strong> These variables are qualitative but have some intrinsic order to them, like a survey result of "strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree", has an order to them, as would something like seniority "junior, mid, senior, executive", etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Nominal Categorical Variables</strong> These variables are qualitative and have no instrinsic order like states in the U.S., brands, colors, favorite food, etc.  These often have a unique value for every observation like a name or email address. A Binary Variable is a special kind of nominal variable that has exactly two possible values, such as Is On? or Day or Night? and often take on True or False as the value.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Central Tendency</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mean</strong> Also often referred to as the average, and represented by x with a bar over it.  It is the sum of all the observations x1 + x2 + ... + xn, divided by the number n of observations. The python numpy library (include <code>import numpy as np</code> ) has .average() and .mean() methods that accept a list of values as input and returns the mean.  The .average() method can optionally accept a weights parameter to calculate a weighted mean.</li>
        <li><strong>Median</strong> The median tells you the value for which half the values in a data set are larger and half are smaller.  The data set must first be sorted, then the value in the middle of the sorted data set is the median.  If there are an even number of values in the data set, then it is reported as both of the middle two values or their average.  Numpy's .median() method takes a list of values and outputs the median, it will average the two middle values if the data set has an even number of values.</li>
        <li><strong>Mode</strong> The mode tells you the most frequently occuring value found in a dataset, and there can be multiple modes if the data set has more than one value with the same max frequency.  The python SciPy library (include <code>from scipy import stats</code> at the top of the file) has a stats.mode() method that takes a list of values and returns an object that contains the mode value and the number of values that equals the mode.  If there are multiple modes, then it always returns the lowest valued mode. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Spread</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Variance</strong> The variance is a measure of how spread out a data set is, and is calculated as the average of the squared difference between each data point and the mean. It is usually notated as σ<sup>2</sup>.  The Numpy python library (<code>import numpy as np</code>) has a .var() method that takes a list of values and returns the variance.</li>
        <li><strong>Standard Deviation</strong> The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance, and is representd by σ.  This is generally easier to interpret than variance because variance will have a squared unit, whereas standard deviation will have the same unit as the mean and the data itself.  The numpy python library has a .std() method that takes a list of values and returns the standard deviation. For normally distributed data, 68.3% of the values are within 1 standard deviation of the mean, 95.5% are with two, and 99.7% are within three.</li>
    </ul>
