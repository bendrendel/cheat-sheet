    <h1>Descriptive Statistics</h1>

    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Variables</strong> Most data sets can be represented as a table, where each row is called an observation, and each column is called a variable.  Each cell contains a value.  Variables generally are either quantitative or categorical.</li>
        <li><strong>Quantitative Variables</strong> Quantitative variables are information about an observation that can only be described by numbers, usually counts or measurements of something.  They are well suited to mathematical analysis.  They are generally either discrete or continuous.  Sometimes something like age might be discrete or continuous, if it is the nearest age in years it is discrete, but if it age in years with a decimal representing fractions of a year then it is continuous.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Discrete Quantitative Variables</strong> These are variables that can only have integer values and represent counts of things, such as number of children in a family, or number of coin flips made</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Quantitative Variables</strong> These are variables that generally represent measurements like length, weight and age that theoretically can take on any real number.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Categorical Variables</strong> These variable group together or classify the observations and can either be ordinal if they have an order, or nominal if not.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ordinal Categorical Variables</strong> These variables are qualitative but have some intrinsic order to them, like a survey result of "strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree", has an order to them, as would something like seniority "junior, mid, senior, executive", etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Nominal Categorical Variables</strong> These variables are qualitative and have no instrinsic order like states in the U.S., brands, colors, favorite food, etc.  These often have a unique value for every observation like a name or email address. A Binary Variable is a special kind of nominal variable that has exactly two possible values, such as Is On? or Day or Night? and often take on True or False as the value.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
