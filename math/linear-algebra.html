    <h1>Linear Algebra</h1>

    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Linear Algebra</strong> The math of linear operations and solving systems of linear equations. Many optimization engineering problems can be reduced to systems of linear equations where we can get a solution of set of solutions.  Much high-performance computing advances are due to software and GPU's optimized around linear algebra with linear transformations of data, rendering 3 dimensional computer graphics, the foundations of machine learning and deep learning are matrix and vector math.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Scalars/Vectors/Matrices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scalars</strong> Scalars are quantities with only a magnitude, e.g. the speed of a car is 40mph</li>
        <li><strong>Vectors</strong> Vectors are quantities with magnitude and direction, e.g. a car is going 50mph to the east.   Vectors are often represented as values in a cartesian coordinate system (1, 2, 0) or &lt1, 2, 0> or vertically between square brackets [] with no commas.  The dimension of a vector are the number of numerical elements required to define the vector.</li>
        <li><strong>Vecotor Magnitude</strong> The magnitude of a vector represented as x, y, z, etc components in a cartesian coordinate system is the square root of the sum of the squared components. Magnitude of a vector a is represented as ||a||. (Think pythagorean theorem a^2 + b^2 = c^2 applied multiple times for multiple dimensions)</li>
        <li><strong>Scalar Multiplication</strong> You can multiply a vector by a scalar, by multiplying each component by the scalar. This is associative.</li>
        <li><strong>Vector Addition/Subtraction</strong> Vectors of the same dimensionality can be added and subtracted from each other by adding and subtracting their individual components.  This is associative and commutative.</li>
        <li><strong>Vector Dot Product</strong> The dot product of two equal dimensional vectors is the sum of the vectors' corresponding components, which is a scalar value.  E.g. (a, b) · (c, d) = a*c + b*d.  It is commutative and distributive.  The magnitude of a vector a is sqrt(a · a) as this will just be the square root of the sum of the squared components of a.  The dot product represents how much one vector goes into another and if the two vectors are perpendicular the dot product is 0.  The angle between two vectors is given by arccos((a · b)/(||a||||b||)</li>
        <li><strong>Matrix</strong> A matrix is usually represented between two brackets [], and by a capital letter A, and described as m x n, with m rows and n columns.  It can be thought of as n, m-dimensional vectors, or a vector can be thought of as a 1 column matrix with m dimensions. A particular element b in the matrix A is identified as the m, n th element where m is the row and n is the column it is in, often denoted as b = A<sub>m, n</sub></li>
