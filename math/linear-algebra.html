    <h1>Linear Algebra</h1>

    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Linear Algebra</strong> The math of linear operations and solving systems of linear equations. Many optimization engineering problems can be reduced to systems of linear equations where we can get a solution of set of solutions.  Much high-performance computing advances are due to software and GPU's optimized around linear algebra with linear transformations of data, rendering 3 dimensional computer graphics, the foundations of machine learning and deep learning are matrix and vector math.</li>
        <li><strong></strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Vectors</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scalars</strong> Scalars are quantities with only a magnitude, e.g. the speed of a car is 40mph</li>
        <li><strong>Vectors</strong> Vectors are quantities with magnitude and direction, e.g. a car is going 50mph to the east.   Vectors are often represented as values in a cartesian coordinate system (1, 2, 0) or &lt1, 2, 0> or vertically between square brackets [] with no commas.  The dimension of a vector are the number of numerical elements required to define the vector.</li>
        <li><strong>Magnitude</strong> The magnitude of a vector represented as x, y, z, etc components in a cartesian coordinate system is the square root of the sum of the squared components.  (Think pythagorean theorem a^2 + b^2 = c^2 applied multiple times for multiple dimensions)</li>
        <li><strong>Scalar Multiplication</strong> You can multiply a vector by a scalar, by multiplying each component by the scalar. This is associative.</li>
        <li><strong>Vector Addition/Subtraction</strong> Vectors of the same dimensionality can be added and subtracted from each other by adding and subtracting their individual components.  This is associative and commutative.</li>
    </ul>
