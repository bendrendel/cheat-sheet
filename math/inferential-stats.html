    <h1>Inferential Statistics</h1>

    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Descriptive statistics tells us about data we have, and inferential statistics helps us infer information about a larger population based on a smaller sample of that population.  Often we don't have access to data about an entire population to do descriptive statistics on and we have to use a smaller sample of it.  This includes hypothesis testing and regression.</li>
        <li>A big part of it is understanding that samples don't always represent the population accurately and part of inferential statistics is quantifying that uncertainty.</li>
    </ul>
