    <h1>Responsive Design</h1>
    <p>
      Responsive Design is a website that resizes and reorganizes content based
      on screen size, screen orientation, platform considerations like if
      scripting is available, user settings like if they have a VPN the site
      shouldn't be blocked, and also the size of other content.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's not about a new design for every concievable device, but more like
      parameterized design, where inherent in the design is how it changes with
      different environment parameters
    </p>

    <h2>Fundamentals of a Responsive Site</h2>

    <h3>Foundations</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>meta viewport</strong> mobile devices commonly default to having a
      wider viewport than the actual screen width, and then shrink the viewport
      down to the screen width. This makes non-responsive websites better on
      mobile devices, but ruins responsive designs because the site won't be
      responding to the actual screen width but rather the wider viewport size
      This tag instructs mobile devices to use the device width and not zoom in
      and should always be used on responsive designs
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Browser Reset: </strong>Include a css reset, the two most common
      are <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/">Reset</a> and
      <a href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">Normalize</a>. Reset
      completely eradicates all styles, while normalize attempts to add
      consistency across browsers, maintaining a default style
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Border Box: </strong>Set all elements to border-box (see
      boxmodel.css)
    </p>
    <p><strong>jquery: </strong>optionally link to jquery if you'd like</p>

    <br />

    <h3>Breakpoints</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Setting Breakpoints: </strong>media query breakpoints should be
      set according to how the content for the page naturally breaks at
      different screen sizes; they shouldn't be set trying to target different
      devices because devices vary so widely. Often its best to keep it simple
      with one breakpoint at ~800px, dividing between phones/tablets and
      laptops/desktops. You can add another breakpoint for more specific
      designs.
    </p>

    <h3>Mobile-first Design</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Mobile First: </strong>A good strategy is to make content look
      great for mobile first, and scale up from there. In your css, this results
      in your main styles being for mobile, and media queries using min-width
      will alter styles for larger screens.
    </p>
    <p>This is beneficial because most traffic these days is mobile, and results in more efficient, less bloated sites, like desktop-size images being downloaded on phones, wasting data.  Starting with limited screen space forces us to better prioritize content and anticipate most common actions, and make loading faster by starting with the most essential version of the site and building up from there in terms of images and code</p>
    <p>You may have several breakpoints, the main style will be for screens all the way down to no width.  Then a media query at min size 530px for 'small screens', one at 800px for medium screens, and one at min size 1200px for large screens.</p>

    <br />

    <h3>Grid Structure</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Float-based grid: </strong>The traditional way to create a column
      layout is modelled below and relies on floating the block-level column
      divs, and using the clearfix hack on rows. Can use semantic HTML by
      replacing container with main, rows with section, and columns with article
      or aside, depending on what the column is
    </p>

    <div class="float-container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="whole column">Column</div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="one-half column">One half column</div>
        <div class="one-half column">One half column</div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="one-third column">One third column</div>
        <div class="one-third column">One third column</div>
        <div class="one-third column">One third column</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      <strong>Flexbox-based grid: </strong>This replaces the traditional way
      with a better method, can also use semantic tags like float-based grid
      example
    </p>

    <div class="flex-container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">Whole-width column</div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          Evenly-divided columns, use flex: 1 regardless of # of cols
        </div>
        <div class="column">Evenly-divided columns</div>
        <div class="column">Evenly-divided columns</div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column _25">
          25% Left Sidebar, use different flex props for different width cols
        </div>
        <div class="column _55">55% Main Content</div>
        <div class="column _20">20% Right Sidebar</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <br />

    <h3>Navigation</h3>
    <p>
      The hardest part is responsive navigation, commonly using the hamburger
      menu icon
    </p>

    <div class="topnav" id="myTopnav">
      <a href="#home" class="active">Home</a>
      <a href="#news">News</a>
      <a href="#contact">Contact</a>
      <a href="#about">About</a>
      <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="icon" onclick="myFunction()">
        <i class="fa fa-bars"></i>
      </a>
    </div>

    <hr />

    <h2>Common Mobile vs Desktop Changes</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>display: none </strong>Use the display: none property/value to
      show and hide things that should only appear on large screens or small
      screens, e.g. for navigation structures that change with screen size
    </p>
    <p><strong>Common patterns: </strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Common for desktop displays to include a non-essential sidebar on right
        hand side that disappears on mobile display, or multiple columns in
        desktop that stack vertically on mobile
      </li>
      <li>
        Also common for navigation menu to simplify or turn into drop downs on
        mobile vs desktop
      </li>
      <li>
        Common for logo to be in upper left on desktop and then move to top
        center above nav on mobile
      </li>
      <li>Less white space on mobile devices</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>Relative measurements</h2>
    <h3>px</h3>
    <p>pixels are not relative</p>

    <br />

    <h3>em and rem</h3>
    <p>
      em and rem should be used for text and any dimension related to text or
      that should scale as text scales (padding & margin around text etc),
      allows scaling to client's default root font size
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>em: </strong>sized as a multiple of the font size of the parent
      element (whether defined or inherited from its parent). e.g. if font-size
      of parent is 18px, then 1.5em will be 27px. good for sizing in comparison
      to nearby elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>rem: </strong>sized as multiple of the font size of the html
      element (root element, whether defined or using default browser font size
      for html element). good for consistent sizing across entire website.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h3>%</h3>
    <p>
      % for non-text HTML elements, often for box-model values like width,
      height, padding, border, and margins, and positioning properties top,
      bottom, left, right
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>%: </strong>for height and width sizes relative to corresponding
      parent dimension (which must be set), for padding and margin all sizes
      relative to width dimension of parent element
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Media Queries</h2>
    <p><strong>@media: </strong>media query ruleset keyword</p>
    <p>
      <strong>only screen: </strong>dictates what device type the rule set, it
      should always be only screen, outdated to use for print, handheld, etc
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>media features: </strong>e.g. and (max-width: 480px), conditions
      that must be met for rule to apply, combine with and for AND logic, and
      commas for OR logic
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>min-width: </strong>browser or screen width must be at least
        this width for style to apply
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>max-width: </strong>browser or screen width must be no more than
        this width for style to apply; combine min-width and max-width values to
        select a range of width for which the style should apply
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>min-device-width: </strong>actual device width must be at least
        this width for style to apply; doesn't matter if browser or viewing area
        is minimized less than device width
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>max-device-width: </strong>actual device width must be no more
        than this width for style to apply; doesn't matter if browser or viewing
        area is minimized less than device width; min/max device width is good
        for targeting specific devices but not when you make the browser smaller
        on a large screen
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>orientation: </strong>can be either portrait (height > width) or
        landscape (width > height)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>CSS Organization: </strong>Its best to put media queries right
      after their equivalent normal style, pairing the normal style and media
      query style, as opposed to all normal styles in one section, and all media
      queries in a separate section
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>HTML link with media query: </strong>You can include a media query
      attribute in the css link element (see head above), that will only load
      the css sheet if the media query condition is met. This could load styles
      to override some of the styles in the main css sheet (always loaded).
      However, this is not as efficient as including media queries all in a
      single css sheet which avoids multiple files needing to load, and should
      only be used if the organizational benefit outweighs the efficiency loss
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Support for older browsers: </strong>If you must support older
      browsers that don't support CSS3 media queries, there are javascript files
      you can include in your project that will make the media queries work for
      old browsers without modification to the CSS
