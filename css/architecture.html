      <h2>Semantic Classes</h2>
      <p>
        Semantic classes describe the nature of an element's content rather than
        the desired styling or presentation of the content
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This is in opposition to "atomic" css where you have many classes that
          each do one styling, and assign many classes to each element like
          "bold red pad-left-20"
        </li>
        <li>
          Semantic CSS is easier to make responsive, easier to identify html
          elements, less chance of regression, less maintenance, easier to
          debug, better hooks, smaller HTML footprint
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Use semantic html tags whenever possible in place of classes, and avoid
        classes like "link" that are redundant of a tag like "a"
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS should specify regular styles so that most elements don't need a
        class, classes should be used when exceptions to regular stylings are
        needed
      </p>
      <p>
        When possible, use good CSS selectors to style elements instead of
        classes, e.g. use <code>article:p first-of-type</code> to style the
        first paragraph of an article instead of giving the first paragraph a
        class of "intro-para"
      </p>
      <p>
        Avoid specifing styles in class name like "largeText" or "blueBkg" or
        "left", because the style and positioning may change in the future,
        instead use "priority-1" or "standout" or "brandcolor"
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider that the semantics of the page content that is useful to
        machines and visitors are handled by html elements, and not by classes.
        Instead, the primary purpose of classes is to be a hook for CSS and JS
        and should communicate useful information to the developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a style is shared (like background color) between many elements,
        this presents a challenge to semantic css, sometimes it is best to make
        a big CSS selector with all the elements selected so you just apply that
        style once and avoid repetition in the css, sometimes its best to have
        separate selectors for each element and apply the style to each one so
        you can also include other styles for each element under one selector,
        and sometimes its best to use a more atomic approach and create a
        special class for that style, and add that class to each element.
      </p>

      <h2>BEM</h2>
      <p>
        BEM stands for Block Element Modifier and is a way of conceptualizing
        the structure of a user interface. It helps keep the relationship
        between HTML and CSS clear for easier maintenance.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Blocks are reusable, independent part of the design, like the hero
          section as a whole, each feature card in the features section, each
          testimonial card in the testimonials section, each button on the page.
          Everything on the page is a block, or part of a block.  Blocks are reusable,
          so you could have multiple things on the page that are the same type of block
          and you'll only need to define styling for that block type once.  Blocks are
          also nestable, so maybe one block gets reused multiple times within a 
          containing block like with a grid of cards inside a page section.  Or perhaps
          you need to combine different blocks in different ways, like a wrapper block
          that adds margins, nested inside a page section block.  But the wrapper block
          also gets nested inside the page header block.
        </li>
        <li>
          Elements belong to blocks and aren't used outside the block they
          belong to, like the title and subtitle in the hero, or a profile photo
          in the testimonial card.  The key is you won't want to reuse the styling
          anywhere else outside the block.  So if a Title style gets used in multiple
          different blocks, then you may want to consider that Title style being its
          own block, nested inside another block.
        </li>
        <li>
          Modifiers are used on blocks or elements to indicate a change to the
          default state of an object, like a class that gets added to a menu to
          indicate it is open or visible, or a modifier to style buttons
          differently like "btn--orange" or "btn--large".  When you add a modifier class
          to an html element, you always also add the main block or element class
          to get the main styling of that block or element, then you add the modifier
          class also to pick up whatever additional styling is contained in the modifier
          class.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        BEM dictates that all CSS selectors target elements directly with
        classes
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This frees you from the cascade so you can move blocks around, nest
          blocks inside of blocks, without consequence
        </li>
        <li>
          BEM dictates classes name like
          "block-name__element-name--modifier-name", where names use - to
          separate words, blocks and elements are separated by two underscores,
          and modifiers are separated by two dashes, can have blocks with a modifier
          directly, or elements with modifiers.  e.g.
          block-name--modifier-name is modifying th block, not an element
        </li>
        <li>
          BEM also dictates single-purpose blocks, such as a block that creates
          columns, that can be reused wherever columns are needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Useful to break each block into its own file. Then use nested CSS in
          the file to make a top-level block selector, with nested selectors for
          each element or modifier
        </li>
        <li>
          BEM should avoid multi-class selectors, and only have a single class
          as a selector. Thus, when using PostCSS nested selectors, use the &
          feature on the nested selectors to copy the top classes name, followed
          by __element. e.g. the top selector is .large-hero, and the nested
          selector is &__title, resulting in a PostCSS output of
          .large-hero__title for the nested selector.
        </li>
        <li>
          Example of what would go in a single block file called _headline.css,
          using PostCSS, where the block has some default styles, a few
          modifiers, and a media query that increases the font-size on larger
          screens. The small modifier also has a nested media query that changes
          the font-size of elements with the small modifier.
          <pre><code>
            .headline {
              font-weight: 300;
              font-size: 2.875rem;
              color: $mainBlue;

              &--centered {
                  text-align: center;
              }

              &--orange {
                  color: $mainOrange;
              }

              &--small {
                font-size: 1.2rem;

                @media (min-width: 1200px) {
                  font-size: 2rem;
                }
              }

              @media (min-width: 1200px) {
                font-size: 4rem;
              }
            }
          </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          HTML element classes might then contain class="headline
          headline--centered headline--orange"
        </li>
      </ul>
