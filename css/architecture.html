      <h2>Semantic Classes</h2>
      <p>
        Semantic classes describe the nature of an element's content rather than
        the desired styling or presentation of the content
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This is in opposition to "atomic" css where you have many classes that
          each do one styling, and assign many classes to each element like
          "bold red pad-left-20"
        </li>
        <li>
          Semantic CSS is easier to make responsive, easier to identify html
          elements, less chance of regression, less maintenance, easier to
          debug, better hooks, smaller HTML footprint
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Use semantic html tags whenever possible in place of classes, and avoid
        classes like "link" that are redundant of a tag like "a"
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS should specify regular styles so that most elements don't need a
        class, classes should be used when exceptions to regular stylings are
        needed
      </p>
      <p>
        When possible, use good CSS selectors to style elements instead of
        classes, e.g. use <code>article:p first-of-type</code> to style the
        first paragraph of an article instead of giving the first paragraph a
        class of "intro-para"
      </p>
      <p>
        Avoid specifing styles in class name like "largeText" or "blueBkg" or
        "left", because the style and positioning may change in the future,
        instead use "priority-1" or "standout" or "brandcolor"
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider that the semantics of the page content that is useful to
        machines and visitors are handled by html elements, and not by classes.
        Instead, the primary purpose of classes is to be a hook for CSS and JS
        and should communicate useful information to the developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a style is shared (like background color) between many elements,
        this presents a challenge to semantic css, sometimes it is best to make
        a big CSS selector with all the elements selected so you just apply that
        style once and avoid repetition in the css, sometimes its best to have
        separate selectors for each element and apply the style to each one so
        you can also include other styles for each element under one selector,
        and sometimes its best to use a more atomic approach and create a
        special class for that style, and add that class to each element.
      </p>

      <h2>BEM</h2>
      <p>
        BEM stands for Block Element Modifier and is a way of conceptualizing
        the structure of a user interface. It helps keep the relationship
        between HTML and CSS clear for easier maintenance.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Blocks are reusable, independent part of the design, like the hero
          section as a whole, each feature card in the features section, each
          testimonial card in the testimonials section, each button on the page
        </li>
        <li>
          Elements belong to blocks and aren't used outside the block they
          belong to, like the title and subtitle in the hero, or a profile photo
          in the testimonial card
        </li>
        <li>
          Modifiers are used on blocks or elements to indicate a change to the
          default state of an object, like a class that gets added to a menu to
          indicate it is open or visible, or a modifier to style buttons
          differently like "btn--orange" or "btn--large"
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        BEM dictates that all CSS selectors target elements directly with
        classes
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This frees you from the cascade so you can move blocks around, nest
          blocks inside of blocks, without consequence
        </li>
        <li>BEM dictates classes name like "block-name__element-name--modifier-name", where names use - to separate words, blocks and elements are separated by two underscores, and modifiers are separated by two dashes, can have block-name--modifier-name with no element</li>
        <li>BEM also dictates single-purpose blocks, such as a block that creates
        columns, that can be reused wherever columns are needed.</li>
        <li>
          Useful to break each block into its own file. Then use nested CSS in
          the file to make a top-level block selector, with nested selectors for
          each element
        </li>
        <li>
          BEM should avoid multi-class selectors, and only have a single class
          as a selector. Thus, when using PostCSS nested selectors, use the &
          feature on the nested selectors to copy the top classes name, followed
          by __element. e.g. the top selector is .large-hero, and the nested
          selector is &__title, resulting in a PostCSS output of
          .large-hero__title for the nested selector.
        </li>
      </ul>
