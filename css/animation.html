    <h1>Animation</h1>
    <h2>Keyframes</h2>
    <p>A special element in your CSS that defines the animation</p>
    <h3>Components</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Name of the animation</strong></li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stages of the animation: </strong>Animations are broken into
        stages, where each stage has defined css property values that are
        reached at a defined percentage of the total animation time
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>CSS Properties: </strong>The property values at each stage
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <code>
      <pre>
        @keyframes bounceIn {
            0% {
                transform: scale(0.1);
                opacity: 0;
            }
            60% {
                transform: scale(1.2);
                opacity: 1;
            }
            100% {
                transform: scale(1);
            }
        }
        </pre
      >
    </code>

    <h2>Animation Properties</h2>
    <p>Properties assigned to the element to animate</p>
    <h3>Components</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>animation-name</strong></li>
      <li>
        <strong>animation-duration: </strong>seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>animation-timing-function: </strong>defines how css property
        values are interpolated between animation stages, e.g., ease (default),
        linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, initial, inherit, custom
        cubic-bezier curve, or steps(#, position) to get discrete jumps between
        keyframes (e.g. step(1, start) will discretely jump from keyframe to keyframe.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>animation-delay: </strong> defined in seconds or milliseconds,
        specifies a delay before animation begins, or can be a negative value to
        start instantly start in the middle of the animation
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>animation-iteration-count: </strong> specifies number of repeats
        of the animation, can be a number, or keywords infinite, initial, or
        inherit
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>animation-direction: </strong> can be normal (default), reverse,
        alternate (normal-reverse-normal-reverse, etc), or alternate-reverse
        (reverse-normal-reverse-normal etc)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>animation-fill-mode: </strong> defines if the initial and end
        states of the animation are in effect before/after the animation, as
        opposed to the element's normal styles, can be normal (default -
        animation doesn't apply), backwards (initial animation state applied
        beforehand), forwards (final animation state applied afterwards), both
        (applies rules of both forwards and backwards)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>animation-play-state: </strong> can be playing or paused, to
        define if animation should run or stay paused
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>animation: </strong>recommended shorthand that combines all of
        the above properties separated by a space, the first two properties are
        required, and can combine multiple animations separated by a comma:
        [animation-name] [animation-duration] [animation-timing-function]
        [animation-delay] [animation-iteration-count] [animation-direction]
        [animation-fill-mode] [animation-play-state], [animation-name]
        [animation-duration] etc.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <code>
      <pre>
        div {
            animation-duration: 2s;
            animation-name: bounceIn;
        }
        </pre
      >
    </code>

    <em>OR</em>

    <code>
      <pre>
        div {
            animation: bounceIn 2s;
        }
        </pre
      >
    </code>

    <h3>Prefixes</h3>
    <p>
      Probably all outdated but in the past, in addition to unprefixed versions,
      you needed to include the -webkit- prefixed version for keyframes,
      animation properties, and transitions for certain browsers. There are
      libraries that can automate this.
    </p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <code>
      <pre>
        div {
            -webkit-animation-duration: 2s;
            animation-duration: 2s;
            -webkit-animation-name: bounceIn;
            animation-name: bounceIn;
        }

        @-webkit-keyframes bounceIn { /* styles */ }
        @keyframes bounceIn { /* styles */ }
        </pre
      >
    </code>

    <h2>Events</h2>
    <p>You can get an animated element's dom reference in javascript with
      e.g. document.getElementById, and then respond to events related to the
      element's animation,  These are animationstart, animationend, and
      animationiteration which fires every time the animation loops (but not
      when it starts and ends)
    </p>

    <h2>Animating Background Images</h2>
    <p>You can set up an element to have a background-image property of
      linear-gradient or radial-gradient, and then set the background-size
      property to be much smaller than the element to effectively create a square
      or circle in the element made by the background-image.  You can position it
      with the background-position property (e.g. 0px 0px for top left, 50% 50% for
      placement in the middle).
    </p>
    <p>You can add multiple background images to an element like above by separating
      each background-image by a comma.  You can place them independently and size
      them independently by separating multiple values by a comma, e.g. 
      background-position: 0px 0px, 15px 15px; could be used to position two different
      background images
    </p>
    <p>Now you can animate the background-images by setting keyframes on the 
      background-position property.  For instance, you could have a square created
      as a background image move back and forth inside an element or around the edge
      of the element as a loading animation.
