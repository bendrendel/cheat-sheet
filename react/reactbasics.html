        <h1>React</h1>
        <p><strong>React: </strong>React is a very popular user interface framework? developed at Facebook, comprised of two libraries, makes for faster apps, more modular and maintainable JS code, more scalable to large apps, more flexible to use beyond web apps</p>
        
        <h2>React Library</h2>
        <p><code>React library: </code>Javascript library containing methods for pure React purposes, mainly allowing you to write JSX with the React.createElement() method, and allowing you to make components with React.Component class</p>
        
        <h3>JSX</h3>
        <p><strong>JSX: </strong>JSX is a syntax extension for Javascript designed for use with the react library, that represents HTML elements in javascript code that can be rendered in the browser. Browsers cannot read this syntax, so any js file using it must be translated to regular Javascript using a JSX Compiler before being sent to a browser.  JSX creates a react element, as does the equivalent React.createElement() method</p>
        <p><strong>JSX Expression: </strong>JSX is treated as an expression by Javascript and can go anywhere a normal expression could go (saved to variable, passed to function, etc.) Composed of a single JSX element that may contain nested JSX elements, but there is only one root element. must enclose in parentheses if more than one line.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Javascript injection: </strong>You can inject a regular javascript expression inside a JSX expression using curly braces {}, if the expression evaluates to an array of JSX elements, then the JSX elements will be rendered one after the other</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><strong>Conditional statements: </strong>if statements cannot be injected into a JSX expression due to compilation details.  Ternary operator does work inside jsx expression, as does utilizing short-circuit evaluation of && operator (if first expression is falsy then falsy is returned by the injection and ignored in the jsx element, but if truthy then the second expression is returned), or can use if statement outside of JSX expression</p></li>
                </ul>                
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>JSX Element: </strong>The building block of JSX syntax, is either HTML-like (if tag name isn't capitalized) or a Component Instance (if tag name is capitalized) HTML-like looks just like an html element with an opening/closing tag (or self-closing tag) and inner HTML content.  Component instances can use opening/closing tags or a self closing tag that is the name of the Component Class to make an instance of.  Self-closing tags must contain a closing forward-slash (unlike in normal HTML where they're optional).  </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Component Instances</li>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Component Instances: </strong>Component instances will create an instance of the component and then run the render method (which often returns HTML-like JSX).  e.g. a component instance in the ReactDOM.render() method will run it's render method</p></li>    
                <li><p><strong>Attributes: </strong>Attributes in a component instance effectively create an object of key-value pairs from the attribute-value pairs which is passed in as the props object, the value can be a string (like HTML-like JSX would have), or you can pass a non-string data type by using an injected javascript expression</p></li>
            </ul>
            <li>HTML-like</li>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Attributes: </strong>JSX Elements can have attributes just like HTML elements, the values of which can be enclosed in single or double quotes depending on style preference, or the value can be injected js. Some attribute names and/or values are a little different in JSX, particularly class in HTML is className in jsx due to class being a reserved word, className in JSX gets rendered as class. also event listener attributes are written in camelCase in JSX instead of all lowercase as in html (e.g. onMouseOver vs onmouseover) and their value should be a function (not an invoked function as in html). commonly, the event listener functions are written as arrow functions, so that this binds to the component object instead of the event target.  It's also common for the event listener function to be defined as a method of the component class outside the render method.  It's also common for a non-invoked function to be passed in as a prop to a component and then injected into the jsx as the event handler.  also the style attribute can be set equal to an injected object whose properties are css properties (some name differences in JSX) with whatever value you want to give them</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>key attribute for list elements: </strong>list elements sometimes need the key attribute included for list items, each list item given a unique key value, never hurts to use them if unsure, but they are needed if the list-items order might be shuffled between renders (e.g search results) or if the list items have memory between renders, e.g. it must be remembered if an item is checked off or not on a to do list.  For any dynamic list where elements may be added, removed,
                reordered, you should use a key.  The key needs to be unique in the list, for example could
                just equal the value of the list item, or maybe an id if the list items come from a database.
                by default if not assigned, a key will equal the index number of the list item, which can
                cause problem like when things are reorder, react can't follow the items around correctly</p></li>
            </ul>
            <li><code>React.createElement()</code> JSX elements are compiled by babel to an invocation of the createElement() method of the React library, and you can use this method yourself to create elements.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The function takes a first argument of the type of element, a second element with an
                        object containing the element's attributes (null if none), and any number of additional
                        arguments that are appended together one after the other as the inner HTML of the element
                    </li>
                    <li>For instance the two snippets below are equivalent
                        <code><pre>
                        return (
                            &ltdiv className="shopping-list">
                                &lth1>Shopping List for {this.props.name}%lt/h1>
                                &ltul>
                                    &ltli>Instagram&lt/li>
                                    &ltli>WhatsApp&lt/li>
                                    &ltli>Oculus&lt/li>
                                &lt/ul>
                            &lt/div>
                        );
                        </pre></code>
                        <code><pre>
                        return React.createElement('div', {className: 'shopping-list'}, 
                            React.createElement('h1', null, 'Shopping List for', this.props.name),
                            React.createElement('ul', null, 
                                React.createElement('li', null, 'Instagram'),
                                React.createElement('li', null, 'WhatsApp'),
                                React.createElement('li', null, 'Oculus')
                            )
                        );
                        </pre></code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>Components</h3>
        <p><strong>Component: </strong>React applications are made out of objects called components, which are small reusable chunks of code responsible for one job, often to render HTML, all are instances of a component class, React applications can contain dozens or even hundreds of components</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Components should each ideally do one thing, and are generally nested with subcomponents.
                    The breakout of components oftens mirrors the data model of what you're representing.
                </li>
            </ul>
        
        <h4>Class Components</h4>
        <p><strong>Component Class: </strong>made by subclassing the React.Component class,  component class names must be capitalized for use in JSX (should be anyway like any class)</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>render method: </strong>for every component class, you must define a render() method that can contains logic, can access other methods and properties of the component class such as the props property using this.props.propertyname, can access variables outside the component class</li>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Render method must include a return statement that returns a react element, typically in the 
                form of a jsx expression which can include component instances and/or HTML-like JSX.  As in the ReactDOM.render method, component instances run their render method, and can have attributes to set props</p></li>
            </ul>
            <li><p><strong>props property: </strong> this is a property of the React.Component class whose constructor takes a single argument (an object) that props gets set equal to.  The prop object's properties can then be accessed in the body of a Component Class (e.g. this.props.myProp), but a component should never change the value of its props, it should be given those values upon instantiation.  It's value is typically set using attributes in a Component Instance, used to pass information to component, values can be any data type including functions like event handlers, which should be named the same as the event listener attribute like onClick or onKeyPress. </p></li>
            <ul>
                <li><p><code>props.children </code> props always has a property called children which returns the innerHTML of the component instance.  If the component instance is self-closing, then it will be undefined.  If the innerHTML contains multiple child elements then they will be placed in an array in props.children, if only one or no children then just the single child or value is returned and not placed in an array.  This could be handy if e.g. you have a component that displays a passed in list,
                well instead of passing it in as a prop, you could render the component as having an opening
                and closing tag instead of self-closing, and put the li elements inside there, just as you would 
                inside an unordered list element.  Then, in the definition of the component, you could have it 
                in the render method that it returns this.props.children to have it return all the li elements that 
                were inside it. </p></li>
            </ul>
            
            <li><p><strong>constructor method: </strong>you have to include a constructor method to add a property inside the component class body (by including this.propertyname = 'value' in the constructor, you can also add properties after the component class has been declared e.g. MyComponent.propName = 'value'), if you do have a constructor method, it must accept a props argument and call super(props) to ensure the constructor of the React.Component class is invoked with any provided props (this happens automatically via the default js constructor when a component class has no constructor) </p></li>
            <li><p><code>defaultprops</code> this is a property that can be defined for a component class that has an object value and the properties are the names of the component class's props and the values are default values to use if a Component Instance does not set the prop.  Possibly common to define this outside the class component, i.e. you define the class component named MyComponent, and then outside of that class definition, you define MyComponent.defaultprops = {myprop: 'default-value'}</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>state property: </strong> a property you can create, an object, usually created in the constructor of a component class and given an initial value, the state property can then be accessed in the body of the component class (e.g. inside body use this.state.someThing), and unlike with props, the state can be changed inside the component class body</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>setState method: </strong>this is a method in the React.Component class, it takes two arguments, the first an object to update the components state with, and secondly a callback that is almost never needed.  after updating the state, it also calls the component's render method, thus it causes immediate changes on screen and cannot be called inside the render method to avoid an infinite loop. The first argument updates the component's current state by updating any of the currents state's properties to the values in the provided object if has that state property.  the provided argument doesn't have to include all of the state's properties.  the most common use of setState is calling it inside a method (especially an event handler) of the component class. You can also use a function as the first argument that returns an object which will be used to set the state.  This function can have a parameter for the previous state, commonly called prevState which can be useful if needing info from the prev state.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>event handler methods: </strong>commonly methods are used to define event handlers that are injected into the rendered html and by convention these should be named something like handleClick or handleKeyPress, depending on the name of the event they handle. If you use 'this' inside an event handler method, then you must include a constructor method in the component class that includes a line to bind the method to 'this'.  (e.g. this.myEventHandler = this.myEventHandler.bind(this)) this is because when the method is injected into jsx as an event handler, it will lose its this, so it needs to have the object name already in place of this</p></li>
            <li><strong>other methods: </strong>the component can also have other methods</li>
        </ul>        
        <p><strong>Modularity: </strong>Common to place each component in its own file, and then used ES6 named import/export or ES6 import/export default to import component modules into other component modules e.g. to render one component with another</p>
        <p><strong>Dynamic Information: </strong>information that can change, components get dynamic information through props (info from outside) and state (info decided by component itself), every other value used in a component should always stay exactly the same</p>
        <p><strong>Process of determining components/state/props: </strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Lay out your components according to your data model.</li>
                <li>Build a static version of the site first, building the component classes, and using props to pass data from parent to child components.  You won't use state at all in the static version because state is for interactivity, i.e. data that changes over time.  All your components will only have render methods and the top level component will be passed your data model as a prop (e.g. some JSON from an API).</li>
                <li>Now determine the minimum number of state variables needed.  Think of all the pieces of data on your site, e.g. an original list of products, a filtered list of products, text in a search field, a filtering checkbox.  If the data is passed in from a parent via props, never changes, or can be computed based on any other state or props, then it's probably not a state variable.  So, an original list of JSON products is passed in to the app via props and isn't state, and the filtered product list can be computed if you know the search field text and filtering checkbox value, and the search field and checkbox are the only two state variables.</li>
                <li>Now determine which component should house each state variable.  It should be housed in a component that is a common parent of all children using the state.  It will pass the state down
                to all of the children that need it as props.
                </li>
                <li>Now you can pass down functions to children as props that update the state of the parent.
                e.g. the value of a search bar component is a state variable in a parent component that is passed
                down as props to the search bar component.  The search bar is also passed a function from the parent
                component as props that will update the parent state variable whenever there is an on input event
                in the search bar.
                </li>
            </ul>    
        </p>
        <p><strong>Component lifecycle: </strong>Component instances go through potentially three stages: mounting, updating, and unmounting. Each stage has is own lifecycle methods. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mounting first calls the constructor(), then render(), then componentDidMount(). The constructor should only do things without side-effects, calling super(props), initializing
            the state, etc.  The render function makes it appear for the first time.  Then, the componentDidMount() method can be included in your component class definition to run code that does have side effects.  e.g. for a clock, the constructor sets the intial time as a state variable, then render renders it, then componentDidMount can start an interval that updates the state variable every second with the new time.  Side effects include asynchronous functions like setInterval or AJAX calls, manually tweaking the DOM, setting a global value and more.
            </li>
            <li>Updating occurs whenever setState() is called or when props are updated.  It will first run render() and the componentDidUpdate().  componentDidUpdate is a good place for code with side effects that should run with each update.  e.g. perhaps the clock is passed a prop that determines if it updates every second or ever millisecond, then you should deal with resetting the interval in the componentDidUpdate() method that checks the value of the prop and updates
            the interval if necessary every time an update occurs.  It's often useful to use the prevProps
            object to compare the current value of a prop to the previous value to determine if something should update or not, e.g. if (this.props.myProp === prevProps.myProp) {go fetch new data or something}.
            </li>
            <li>Unmounting calls the componentWillUnmount() method.  You should define this method in your component class definition to clean up any side effects in your componentDidMount method, e.g. you can use clearInterval() to stop the clock interval from continuing.  Side effects like this should always be cleaned up in your componentWillUnmount() method to avoid memory leaks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Function Components</h4>
        <p>Components can also be created as functions instead of classes. The function returns the jsx 
            normally found in the render method of a class component.  The function can have a parameter of props to access props in the function body, accessed like props.propName.  The following are equivalent:
        </p>
        <code>
            export class MyComponentClass extends React.Component {
                render() {
                    return &ltdiv>Here is a prop: this.props.myProp&ltdiv>
                }
            }

            export const MyComponentFunction = (props) => {
                return &ltdiv>Here is a prop: this.props.myProp&ltdiv>
            }
        </code>
        <p><strong>Hooks: </strong>Hooks allow you to use state and lifecycle methods with function components</p>


        <br> 
    
        <h2>ReactDOM Library</h2>
        <p><code>ReactDOM library: </code>JavaScript library containing several React-specific methods for interacting with and rendering to the DOM such as ReactDOM.render().  You don't need to include this in component modules
        that don't render anything, and are just imported into other modules that do the actual rendering with
        ReactDom.</p>

        <h3>Rendering</h3>
        <p><strong>Virtual DOM: </strong>In React, every DOM object gets a corresponding virtual DOM object.  When a JSX element is rendered, all virtual DOM objects are updated, then compared to a snapshot before updating (diffing), then only changed objects get updated in the real DOM. this is much faster than many frameworks that update the DOM inefficiently by updating more object than needed (e.g. updating a whole list instead of just the item that changed)</p>
        <p><code>ReactDOM.render(jsx, appendtoelement)</code> this is a method of the ReactDOM library that will append the first argument jsx expression to the second argument expression that returns a DOM element, thus rendering the JSX in the browser, if the jsx expression is a Component Instance then its .render() method is automatically invoked which typically returns html-like jsx that will then be rendered</p>
