        <p><strong>Stateful Component: </strong>Any component with a state property</p>
        <p><strong>Stateless Component: </strong>Any component without a state property</p>

        Common Pattern:
        Parent components are stateful, and render child components that are stateless.
        One child component updates the parent state, and another displays the state, promoting one task per component

        Building to that pattern:

        Pattern 1
        A stateful (parent) component passes state info to a stateless (child) one as props
        Example 1: A stateful parent component passes a state property as a prop to a stateless child component that it can then use in some way

        Pattern 2 (builds on pattern 1)
        A stateless (child) component updates the state of a stateful (parent) one
        Examples 2 & 3: A stateful parent component passes a state-changing method as a prop to a stateless child component that it can then call to change the parent's state (usually or maybe always used as an event handler)
        - Note: The state-changing method in the Parent component must use 'this' to call this.setState, thus it needs to use bind in the constructor just like any event-handling method that uses 'this' would.  In this case, the method is passed to a child component which then passes it to an event where it loses its this.
        - Also note: In the more complex Example 3, it shows a common pattern when you need to use information from the event object to call the state-changing method with

        Pattern 3 (builds on pattern 2)
        A stateless (child) component updates the state of a stateful (parent) one, which re-renders a different stateless (child) component being passed state info from the stateful (parent) one as props
        Example 4: A parent has two child components, one that can update the parent's state using a state-changing method from the parent, and the other is passed state info for display
