        <p><strong>Stateful Component: </strong>Any component with a state property</p>
        <p><strong>Stateless Component: </strong>Any component without a state property</p>

        <h2>Common Pattern</h2>
        <p>Parent components are stateful, and render child components that are stateless.
        One child component updates the parent state, and another displays the state, promoting one task per component</p>
        
        <h3>Building to that pattern:</h3>
        
        <h4>Pattern 1</h4>
        <p>A stateful (parent) component passes state info to a stateless (child) one as props</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Example 1: A stateful parent component passes a state property as a prop to a stateless child component that it can then use in some way</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Pattern 2 (builds on pattern 1)</h4>
        <p>A stateless (child) component updates the state of a stateful (parent) one</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Examples 2 & 3: A stateful parent component passes a state-changing method as a prop to a stateless child component that it can then call to change the parent's state (usually or maybe always used as an event handler)</li>
            <li>Note: The state-changing method in the Parent component must use 'this' to call this.setState, thus it needs to use bind in the constructor just like any event-handling method that uses 'this' would.  In this case, the method is passed to a child component which then passes it to an event where it loses its this.</li>
            <li>Also note: In the more complex Example 3, it shows a common pattern when you need to use information from the event object to call the state-changing method with</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Pattern 3 (builds on pattern 2)</h4>
        <p>A stateless (child) component updates the state of a stateful (parent) one, which re-renders a different stateless (child) component being passed state info from the stateful (parent) one as props</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Example 4: A parent has two child components, one that can update the parent's state using a state-changing method from the parent, and the other is passed state info for display</li>
        </ul>
