    <h1>Testing Libraries</h1>

    <h2>Mocha</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Mocha is a javascript test framework, which should be installed using <code>npm install mocha -D</code> in the root directory of a project, to save it to the dev dependcies of the project (-D)</li>
        <li>Once installed, it can be executed from the project root directory with <code>./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha</code>, however it is more common to set it as the test script
        in the project's package.json by setting <code>"test": "mocha"</code> in the scripts object, so mocha can be executed using <code>npm test</code>. This will run the full test suite instead of having
        to run each test in your test folder individually.  You can put <code>"test": "mocha test/**/*_test.js"</code> to specifically run anything in any folder of the test directory that ends in _test.</li>
        <li>Typically the architecture is you'll have a test folder in the root of your project, with one or more js files containing tests.  You might have an index.js file, and a corresponding index_test.js file in the test folder.  In the index_test.js you'll require in index.js at the top (and index.js will need a module.exports statement) so you can test the functionality in index.js.  You'll also typically require in the assert core module or other assertion library like chai.  You don't have to require in Mocha if its been installed as described above.</li>
        <li>The <code>describe()</code> and <code>it()</code> are mocha methods that provide structure to your test code.  They both accept two arguments, a descriptive string and a callback function.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><code>describe()</code> groups related tests together, generally grouping together a test suite. the first argument should describe the grouping, and the callback function contains the test code and may include nested
            describe() functions to create subgroups of tests</li>
            <li><code>it()</code> defines the actual tests, generally each one is a unit test or a test case.  the first argument should describes the functionality tested such as 'returns argument with highest value', and the callback function should
            define the test</li>
            <li>Example code: 
                <code><pre>
                    describe('Math', () => {
                        describe('.max', () => {
                            it('returns the argument with the highest value', () => {
                                // Your test goes here
                            });
                            it('returns -Infinity when no arguments are provided', () => {
                                // Your test goes here
                            });
                        });
                    });
                </pre></code>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>The <code>assert</code> library is a core node module, and is commonly used with Mocha to perform a test. (Chai is another commonly used assertion library with Mocha) It must be imported to the test file with <code>const assert = require('assert');</code></li>
        <ul>
            <li><code>assert.ok()</code> accepts a single conditional statement such as <code>assert.ok(myVar === 3)</code> and throws an AssertionError if condition is false.  This communciates to mocha that a test has failed and mocha then logs it to the console.</li>
            <li><code>assert.equal()</code> and <code>assert.strictEqual()</code> can and should (for a more expressive, easier to read test) be used instead of .ok() when you just want to test if two items are equal, .equal does a loose == comparison and .strictEqual does a strict === comparison. e.g. <code>assert.strictEqual(result, expected)</code> where typically the result/actual is put first and the expected second</li>
            <li><code>assert.deepEqual()</code> should be used when comparing equality between two objects or two arrays. Comparing distinct but identical objects or arrays with == or === will result in false, because the objects/arrays are not in the same location in memory.</li>
            <li>There are other assert methods for specific circumstances that should generally be used instead of the more generic ok() method for more expressive tests that are easier to read</li>     
            <li>Example Code:
                <code><pre>
                    describe('+', () => {
                        it('returns the sum of its arguments', () => {
                            // Write assertion here
                            assert.ok(3 + 4 === 7);
                        });
                    });
                </pre></code>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Test Phases are a good way to organize the test code inside an it statement callback function, to make it more maintainable, readable, and expressive</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Setup: create any variables, conditions, etc. needed to perform your test</li>
            <li>Exercise: using your setup, execute the actual functionality being tested</li>
            <li>Verify: using the outcome of the excerise, compare to expected outcome, can write an if statement to make this comparison and throw error if it fails, but the assert library provides a more compact way of doing that, making the test more expressive.</li>
            <li>Teardown: not always needed, this resets any conditions changed during the test such as altering files or directory structure, changing read/write permissions for a file, editing database records.
                This ensures your test is isolated.
            </li>
            <li>Example Code:
                <code><pre>
                    describe('appendFileSync', () => {
                        it('writes a string to text file at given path name', () => {

                            // Setup
                            const path = './message.txt';
                            const str = 'Hello Node.js';
                            
                            // Exercise: write to file
                            fs.appendFileSync(path, str);

                            // Verify: compare file contents to string
                            const contents = fs.readFileSync(path);
                            assert.ok(contents.toString() === str);

                            // Teardown: delete path
                            fs.unlinkSync(path);
                        });
                    });
                </pre></code>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Hooks are generally a better way to write setup and teardown code instead of including it directly in your it callback code.  Hooks are included inside the describe callback function along with the
            it function calls.  Hooks include <code>beforeEach(), afterEach(), before(), after()</code> and accept a single callback function as an argument.  For example, the provided callback function for afterEach() will
            run after every time an it callback runs in the same describe callback.  This is especially important to use for teardown code because it ensures the teardown code will run even if the it callback ends early
            due to an assertError or other error being thrown.  The teardown code would not run after the error if it was included in the it callback directly.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Example code:
                <code><pre>
                    describe('example', () => {
                    
                        afterEach(() => {
                            // teardown goes here
                        });
                        
                        it('.sample', () => {
                            // test goes here
                        });
                    });
                </pre></code>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Jest</h2>
    <h3>Basics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Jest is another javascript test framework and the default one used for React applications.  It needs to be installed for a project by initiliazing the project with npm (npm init) if it isn't already, and then running <code>npm install jest -D</code> to install to dev dependencies.  Then in your package.json file, under scripts, make sure you have <code>"scripts" : { "test": "jest" }</code> so that jest runs when you use the command <code>npm test</code>.  If your project uses babel, you will need to configure jest to work with babel, first by installing <code>npm install babel-jest -D</code>.  Now in your <code>.babelrc</code> file, you need to add <code>"presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]</code> and in your scripts in your package.json file, you can add <code>"test:watch": "npm test -- --watch"</code>, allowing you to run the command <code>npm run test:watch</code> to run tests on every file change.  All that said, if you made a react project with create-react-app then jest should already be installed, and <code>npm test</code> should already be configured to run jest tests</li>
        <li>By default, jest expects all tests to be saved in a folder in your root directory called <code>__tests__</code>.  By some conventions, you name each test file as <code>functionalityToTest.spec.js</code> where functionalityToTest is any descriptive name of the functionality to be tested in the file and .spec is included as an old Ruby convention indicating the file is a specification of functionality.  Some recommending colocating test files with what they're testing, so if you have a component file, next to that component file have a folder named __tests__ that contains tests for that component.</li>
        <li>As with Mocha, the typical usage is that you would import the functionality with <code>myFunction = require('../myFile/myCode.js')</code> to test from some javascript file in your project (and export the functionality in that file using module.exports = myFunction), and then you can use that funcitonality in your test file to exercise/test it. You shouldn't need to import Jest in your test files in any way if you've installed it for the project as described above</li>
        <li>Basic test syntax is similar to Mocha.  Instead of it() you may see test(), but both can be used in Jest and they mean the exact same thing, test() is the official method and it() is an alias for it. Also, Jest provides a special syntax for exercising and verifying, namely <code>expect().toEqual()</code>, where expect() wraps what you want to test, accepting an argument like a call to a function being tested that gives some output, and toEqual() is the matcher function that accepts an argument that that output should be equal to.  There are other 'matcher' functions besides .toEqual() like .toThrowError(Error('expected error msg here')) depending on the nature of the verification</li>
        <li>With react, each component will have its own test file.  Within each test file, use the describe function at the top level to separate out various contexts, e.g. describe('rendering') to hold all testing related to rendered output, describe('callbacks') to hold all tests related to callbacks and interactions, describe('lifecycle') to hold all tests related to lifecycle methods, etc. Under each top level describe block, don't be afraid of nesting describe blocks for specific conditions. E.g. you could have three levels like so: describe('rendering') > describe('initial state') > describe('when there is an initial value') / describe('when there is no initial value').  For each it block, use only one assertion </li>
        <li>Example:
            <code><pre>
                describe("Filter function", () => {
                    test("it should filter by a search term (link)", () => {

                        // Setup
                        const input = [
                            { id: 1, url: "https://www.url1.dev" },
                            { id: 2, url: "https://www.url2.dev" },
                            { id: 3, url: "https://www.link3.dev" }
                        ];

                        const output = [{ id: 3, url: "https://www.link3.dev" }];

                        //Exercise and Verify
                        expect(filterByTerm(input, "link")).toEqual(output);
                    });
                });
            </pre></code>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Code Coverage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Jest provides a code coverage analysis feature.  This provides a report of how well your test files covers the file that is imported and tested.  If there are lines in the file that are never tested by your test file, then the report will indicate those lines and give percentage of lines covered, and some other info.  This coverage analysis can be run in a few ways.  You can run <code>npm test -- --coverage</code> to get a report in the command line after the test runs.  You can change your package.json scripts.test property from <code>"jest"</code> to <code>"jest --coverage</code> to always run the coverage report when you run <code>npm test</code>.  You can also instead add a separate new property to your package.json file outside of the scripts property that is <code>"jest": { "collectCoverage": true, "coverageReporters": ["html"] }</code> which will also always run the coverage report when you run <code>npm test</code> and the coverageReporters property can be left out to simply run reports in the command line, or included to instead print the reports to html files in a folder called 'coverage' in your root directory and which contain even more info than the command line report.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Snapshot Testing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You can install an additional library called react test renderer to use with jest to perform snapshot testing, which allows your tests to create snapshots of the rendered component throughout the test.  Alternatively, you can use enzyme to render your components instead of react test renderer.  Each time you run the test with <code>npm run test</code>, it will compare to the previous snapshot and let you know if there are any changes, which you can confirm are intentional or not.</li>
        <li>If you used create-react-app to set up your app, then all you need to do is run <code>npm install react-test-renderer -D</code> in your root to install to dev dependencies. If you didn't use create-react-app there are additional steps.  You then import renderer from react-test-renderer in your test file to use it.</li>
        <li>Snapshot testing is great to validate the rendered structure of a component, but should be used in conjunction with regular testing.  A basic use of snapshot testing would be to compare your component's rendered HTML to a stored snapshot of the rendered HTML from a previous render, so you can detect if anything has changed an decide if that was intentional or not.  The snapshot of the HTML will be stored in e.g. src/__snapshots__/App.test.js.snapshot, if you are creating the snapshots in your tests in the App.test.js file.  The snapshot is simply the HTML produced, and it shoudl be converted to JSON for making comparisons in the test. The first time you run the test in App.test.js the snapshot will not exist and it will automatically be created by renderer.create().  Future runs of the test will compare to this stored snapshot.  The test will fail if they don't match.  However, if you intended for the snapshot to change, then you simply press u in the terminal window where tests are being run to update the stored snapshot.</li>
        <li>A basic example using react-test-render:
        <code><pre>
                // src/App.test.js
                import React from 'react';
                import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';
                import App from './App';
                
                it('matches the snapshot', () => {
                    const tree = renderer.create(&ltApp />).toJSON();
                    expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
                });
        </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>A basic example using enzyme instead:
            <code><pre>
                // src/App.test.js
                import React from 'react';
                import { shallow } from 'enzyme';
                import App from './App';

                it("renders correctly", () => {
                    const wrapper = shallow(
                        &ltApp />
                    );
                    expect(wrapper).toMatchSnapshot();
                });
            </pre></code>
        </li>  
        <li>Now, imagine you had e.g. a component called Link that lets you create custom links and that has methods called onMouseEnter and onMouseLeave that change a 'status' state variable indicating if the link is hovered over or not. You could have a test that calls those methods and takes a snapshot of the component after the method is called as so:
        <code><pre>
            // Link.react.test.js
            import React from 'react';
            import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';
            import Link from '../Link.react';

            test('Link changes the class when hovered', () => {
                const component = renderer.create(
                    &ltLink page="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook&lt/Link>,
                );
                let tree = component.toJSON();
                expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();

                // manually trigger the callback
                tree.props.onMouseEnter();
                // re-rendering
                tree = component.toJSON();
                expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();

                // manually trigger the callback
                tree.props.onMouseLeave();
                // re-rendering
                tree = component.toJSON();
                expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
            });
        </pre></code> This will create a snapshot file in your test folder called Link.react.test.js.snapshot and will include a snapshot of the HTML that the component rendered each time you call .toMatchSnapshot().  Next time you test, if the snapshots don't match you'll get an error.  You can override the error by running <code>jest -u</code> which will overwrite the existing snapshot.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mocks</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mock functions can be made with Jest to replace real functions in the implementation code.  They provide lots of useful properties through their .mock property that you can run assertions on to make sure they are called the correct number of times, with the correct arguments, and return the correct values.  e.g. if we were testing the following function:
            <code><pre>
                function forEach(items, callback) {
                    for (let index = 0; index &lt items.length; index++) {
                        callback(items[index]);
                    }
                }
            </pre></code>
            then we could use the following mock and assertions to help test it
            <code><pre>
                const mockCallback = jest.fn(x => 42 + x);
                forEach([0, 1], mockCallback);

                // The mock function is called twice
                expect(mockCallback.mock.calls.length).toBe(2);

                // The first argument of the first call to the function was 0
                expect(mockCallback.mock.calls[0][0]).toBe(0);

                // The first argument of the second call to the function was 1
                expect(mockCallback.mock.calls[1][0]).toBe(1);

                // The return value of the first call to the function was 42
                expect(mockCallback.mock.results[0].value).toBe(42);
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>Mock functions can also be made that don't contain any actual logic, but are just made to return a specified value.  You can chain together as many .mockReturnValueOnce calls as you want, and every time the mock function is called it will move down the chain an return the next specified value. e.g. 
            <code><pre>
                const filterTestFn = jest.fn();

                // Make the mock return `true` for the first call,
                // and `false` for the second call
                filterTestFn.mockReturnValueOnce(true).mockReturnValueOnce(false);

                const result = [11, 12].filter(num => filterTestFn(num));

                console.log(result);
                // > [11]
                console.log(filterTestFn.mock.calls[0][0]); // 11
                console.log(filterTestFn.mock.calls[1][0]); // 12
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>Mock function can be used to mock modules that are coded to hit an API to replace making an actual call to the API.  e.g if we were testing this module:
            <code><pre>
                // users.js
                import axios from 'axios';

                class Users {
                static all() {
                    return axios.get('/users.json').then(resp => resp.data);
                }
                }

                export default Users;
            </pre></code>
            our test code could use a mock for the get request as so:
            <code><pre>
                // users.test.js
                import axios from 'axios';
                import Users from './users';

                jest.mock('axios');

                test('should fetch users', () => {
                    const users = [{name: 'Bob'}];
                    const resp = {data: users};
                    axios.get.mockResolvedValue(resp);

                    // or you could use the following depending on your use case:
                    // axios.get.mockImplementation(() => Promise.resolve(resp))

                    return Users.all().then(data => expect(data).toEqual(users));
                });
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>Mocks can be used to replace only certain parts of an imported module, leaving the implementation code intact for other parts.  If we were testing:
            <code><pre>
                // foo-bar-baz.js
                export const foo = 'foo';
                export const bar = () => 'bar';
                export default () => 'baz';
            </pre></code>
            then certain parts of it could be replace with a mock like so:
            <code><pre>
                //test.js
                import defaultExport, {bar, foo} from '../foo-bar-baz';

                jest.mock('../foo-bar-baz', () => {
                    const originalModule = jest.requireActual('../foo-bar-baz');

                    //Mock the default export and named export 'foo'
                    return {
                        __esModule: true,
                        ...originalModule,
                        default: jest.fn(() => 'mocked baz'),
                        foo: 'mocked foo',
                    };
                });

                test('should do a partial mock', () => {
                    const defaultExportResult = defaultExport();
                    expect(defaultExportResult).toBe('mocked baz');
                    expect(defaultExport).toHaveBeenCalled();

                    expect(foo).toBe('mocked foo');
                    expect(bar()).toBe('bar');
                });
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>To test components that render complex child components (maybe they make API calls or access local storage) you can use jest.mock to create mocks of these components that replace the real thing when testing.  For example. suppose you had an App component that imports a component <code>import MyComponent from './MyComponent';</code> and renders MyComponent.  Suppose you want to test your App component, and MyComponent makes an API call that you don't need to test.  Your test could use jest.mock as follows:
        <code><pre>
            import React from 'react';
            import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
            import App from './App';

            jest.mock('./MyComponent', () => () => (&ltdiv>Hello World&lt/div>));

            test('renders', () => {
                const { container } = render(&ltApp/>);
                expect(container.textContent)
                    .toMatch('Hello World');
            });
        </pre></code>
        Alternatively you can create a separate file where you create the mock instead of defining it inline as above.  The file should be located in a folder next to the actual component you want to mock, e.g. the mock for ./MyComponent.js should be in ./__mocks__/MyComponent.js. when you call jest.mock on MyComponent, it will automatically find the mocked component when no inline mock is provided.  Thus the test is the same as above except the call to jest.mock should be <code>jest.mock('./MyComponent');</code> The mock should look like:
        <code><pre>
            import React from 'react';

            const MyMockComponent = () => (&ltdiv>Hello World&lt/div>);

            export default MyMockComponent;
        </pre></code></li>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Enzyme</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Enzyme is a testing library to help test the output of React components.  It needs to be installed in the project's root with <code>npm install enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 -D</code>, which actually is to install both the enzyme library and the adapater library that makes enzyme work with react v16.  You will install a different adapter library depending on the version of react you are using.  Using enzyme with react also depends on having react and react-dom installed which should be already for your react app if you used create-react-app.</li>
        <li>To use enzyme in tests, you need a setupTests.js file in your src/ folder, that tells enzyme what adapter to use.  create-react-app is configured to automatically run this file before running tests.  The file should include the following code:
            <code><pre>
                import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
                import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16';

                Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>Enzyme works in tandem with test frameworks such as Mocha and Jest and assertion libraries, to handle the actual organization, running of tests.  Enzyme simply allows you to render React components in the test so that you can check various things about the render.  It provides several methods to do the rendering to different extents:
            <ul>
                <li>The <code>.shallow</code> method is the least intensive rendering and only renders a single component, no child components are rendered.  Shallow rendering is a little less intensive and is what you should use 99% of the time, it is a simulated rendering of a component tree that doesn't require the DOM and only goes one level of components deep, allowing for testing of the component's rendered contents, and simulation of user interaction.</li>
                <li>The <code>.render</code> method is a little more intensive because it also renders the child components to static html. </li>
                <li>The <code>.mount</code> method does the most in-depth rendering because it fully renders the component like shallow, fully renders the component children like render, and also puts them in the DOM. This allows for testing of interaction with DOM APIs and any props passed in.  You should always call <code>.unmount</code> on the component after the test is done for cleanup.  Full DOM rendering mounts the component in the DOM and is meant for when components interact with the DOM or for components wrapped in higher order components.  You should very rarely have a need to use full DOM (Mount) rendering because it runs your whole component tree and usually with tests you just should test one isolated component, and it also slows your tests down a lot due to the DOM rendering. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>A basic content and user interaction test using enzyme for the App component would be stored at src/App.test.js.  It could first test the initial state of the component by making a shallow render of the App comoponent, saving it to the variable wrapper.  Shallow renders then have method you can use, e.g. to find a paragraph element in the component and get the innerHTML text of it.  Finally it can test that text is equal to an expected value. Next, it could test user interaction, say there is a button element rendered by App, and it has a className of 'increment'.  Enzyme can simulate a click of that button, and then you can again test the paragraph element to test it has the correct value after the click.  The code might look like this, being used here with Jest:
            <code><pre>
                    import React from 'react';
                    import { shallow } from 'enzyme';
                    import App from './App';
                    
                    describe('App component', () => {
                        it('starts with a count of 0', () => {
                            const wrapper = shallow(&ltApp />);
                            const text = wrapper.find('p').text();
                            expect(text).toEqual('Count: 0');
                        });
                        it('increments count by 1 when the increment button is clicked', () => {
                            const wrapper = shallow(&ltApp />);
                            const incrementBtn = wrapper.find('button.increment');
                            incrementBtn.simulate('click');
                            const text = wrapper.find('p').text();
                            expect(text).toEqual('Count: 1');
                        });
                    });

    <h2>Selenium</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Selenium is a browser automation tool, meaning it can emulate browser interactions as an end user would to perform functional testing, can replace manual testing</li>
        <li>The core of selenium is its web driver, which works across multiple web browsers, an example use is:
            <code><pre>
                const {Builder, By, Key, until} = require('selenium-webdriver');

                (async function example() {

                    try {
                        // Navigate to Url
                        await driver.get('https://www.google.com');

                        // Enter text "cheese" and perform keyboard action "Enter"
                        await driver.findElement(By.name('q')).sendKeys('cheese', Key.ENTER);
