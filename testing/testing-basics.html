    <h1>Testing Basics</h1>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Software Testing </strong>Assessing the completeness and quality of computer software,
            usually by comparing actual behavior/outcome to expected behavior/outcome.</li>
        <li><strong>Bugs </strong>An error, fault, or flaw making software behave in an unexpected way.</li>
        <li><strong>Manual Testing </strong>Testing done by a human interacting with the system</li>
        <li><strong>Automated Testing </strong>Testing done by software interacting with the system.
            This is faster and more reliable than manual testing and can be done more frequently, 
            often after every significant change to the software.  Developers use test frameworks to organize
            automated tests.</li>
        <li><strong>Functional Testing</strong> This is testing from the user's persepctive and focuses that business requirements are met.  It is usually black box testing meaning no consideration is given to the internal code structure.  Only the functionality and behavior of modules as seen from the end user is tested to ensure they meet requirements. This is critical to ensure software is ready for release.</li>
        <li><strong>Test Code </strong>The code written to test software, in contrast to implementation
            code that is the code of the software itself.  Often stored along with implementation code.
            e.g. index.js is the implementation code and in the same folder is index-test.js with test code</li>
        <li><strong>Test Suite </strong>A collection of tests for an application.  A good test suite is maintainable, complete, fast, isolated, reliable, and expressive (MC-FIRE)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Fast: Fast tests encourage the developer to run tests more often and save time, integration tests generally take longer than unit tests, so a test suite that is heavy on integration tests will be slower</li>
            <li>Complete: A test suite that cover 100% of your code base will give you confidence the program is working correctly</li>
            <li>Reliable: The test suite gives the same output for the same version of the program, i.e. it doesn't fail one time and then pass the next</li>
            <li>Isolated: Tests don't make changes that persist when the test is done running, which could impact other tests or have other unexpected results</li>
            <li>Maintainable: Well-organized so it is easy to add, edit, and remove tests, encouraging completeness</li>
            <li>Expressive: Tests should be descriptive of functionality tested, which effectively documents the purpose of the software</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Documentation </strong>Any content separate from implementation code explaining how it
            works or how to use it.  Tests can be a form of documentation that is unique in that it is
            both readable by humans and computers to confirm it works as described.</li>
        <li><strong>Coverage </strong>Refers to the scope of what is tested. Often testing only covers functionality - i.e. meeting the requirements.  But testing could expand coverage to security, ease of use, and speed</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Code Coverage: This refers to automated tests, and the extent to which they test every area of code</li>
            <li>Test Coverage: This refers to the QA team testing that the software meets the requirements, and the extent to which it tests all the requirements</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Product Coverage: The extent to which all areas of the product are tested</li>
                <li>Risk Coverage: The extent to which possible risks have been tested for</li>
                <li>Requirements Coverage: The extent to which all requirements have been tested</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Regression </strong>When previously tested functionality no longer passes the tests. Can
            happen when new features are implemented.</li>
        <li><strong>Mock Testing </strong>This is when you use a fake version of an internal or external service (e.g. JSON from an API), for testing purposes. This is good to use when possible to save time when running the test.  Hitting an actual API in your test makes the test slow and fragile, and so faking the call to the API and returning some fake data can be done using a mock.</li>
        <li><strong>Stub Testing </strong>Similar to mock testing, except you only fake some portion of the internal or external service that is specifically needed for the test.  Like mock testing, this is good to use to save time when running the test.  An example is instead of creating an actual error condition by e.g. creating a corrupt file programmatically and then testing what happens when your program tries to read it, you could stub the file system with some functionality that returns the error code for a corrupt file and feed that to your test, instead of actually creating the corrupt file.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Test Driven Development (TDD)</h2>
    <p>A development method that writes test code to define program behavior before implementation code, and only writes implementation code in response to failed tests, addressing one failure at a time.</p>
    <p>Phases of test-drive development:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Add a test</strong> Convert requirements to tests, before code is written</li>
        <li><strong>Run all tests - fail</strong> The new tests should fail because the requirements haven't been met yet</li>
        <li><strong>Write simplest code to pass test</strong> Inelegant, hard-coded is fine</li>
        <li><strong>Run all tests - pass</strong> Revise code until all tests pass</li>
        <li><strong>Refactor</strong> Now make the code more logical, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Repeat</strong> Repeat this process for every new piece of functionality, generally using unit tests</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is often simplified as:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Red: </strong>Write tests to describe how code should behave, tests fail (red) because code doesn't meet requirement</li>
        <li><strong>Green: </strong>Write the minimum possible code to address the test's error message.  Repeat until all tests pass (green).  e.g. the object you are testing doesn't exist (reference error) so you create the object.  Then the method in the object doesn't exist so you create the method.  Then the method returns undefined, so you make it return the hard-coded expected result, now the test passes.</li>
        <li><strong>Refactor: </strong>Refactor code while testing often to ensure it stays green, and backtracking if it doesn't. This includes refactoring both test code and implementation code.  e.g. you may refactor your test code to be broken into setup/exercise/verify phases. You may add an additional test that feeds your method a different input expecting a different result and see that your method fails the test because it is returning the hard-coded expected result of the previous test. This forces you to refactor the implementation code to return a dynamic value based on input.  You might then write a test for edge cases, like providing the wrong data type as input or an empty array as input, and let that fail and guide refactoring of implementation code.  You may also simply refactor implementation code to make it more concise, reduce duplication, use more efficient methods, etc.  You may or may not need to refactor at all in this step, depending on the complexity of the functionality and testing.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing Heirarchy</h2>
    <p>Testing generally breaks down to Unit Testing, Integration Testing, Component Testing, UI Testing, and End to End Testing.  Unit/Component Testing is the fastest and cheapest testing and is done often.  You move up the heirarchy only as previous tests are exhuasted, as higher up tests are slower and more resource expensive. Balance should be more unit tests and less and less tests as you get to E2E tests.  E2E tests provide lots of confidence but are slow expensive to write and run.</p>
    <h3>Unit Testing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Automated tests written and run by developers, testing small units of code, such as a single class, a function, a module, a method, etc.</li>
        <li>Needs to be used in conjuntion with integration testing, and other tests that test functionality of units working together</li>
        <li>Expect Unit Tests to evolve as the implementation code evolves and implementation details change, unit test code is not as static as higher level tests that test overall functionality that doesn't change as much.</li>
        <li>Can be used as a design-specification, essentially they define what needs to be built and how it should work and can simultaneously be used to test if requirements are met.</li>
        <li>Unit Testing is fast and cheap, and you should rely heavily on these in your test suite</li>
        <li>Unit testing done in the node environment (not in browser), everything outside the unit is mocked.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Integration Testing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This tests modules which have been unit tested, and aggregates them to test as a group.  Happens after unit testing,
            but before validation and system testing.
        </li>
        <li>Different methods can be used such as big-bang testing which combines large aggregates of modules, or can systematically
            test smaller aggregates first, building up to larger aggregates.
        </li>
        <li>Integration Testing is slower and more expensive on resources than unit testing, and should only be done once unit tests have been exhuasted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Component Testing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Testing the UI and possibly its integration with business logic from inside</li>
        <li>Still running in node usually (not in browser), with outside services mocked</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>UI Layer Testing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Testing major modules of the app from the outside</li>
        <li>Running in actual browser with mock servers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>End to End (E2E) Testing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Testing entire app from outside</li>
        <li>Running in actual browser, with real servers usually on production</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Contract Testing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When two services integrate with each other they have expectations about what is received and returned, which can be thought of as a contract between integrated endpoints.</li>
        <li>You can test internal services (microservices architecture) this way also, and use mocks and stubs for the expected returned values from the other system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Testing React Apps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use jest and enzyme to test react apps.  Jest comes pre-installed if you use create-react app, so you don't need to do anything to get jest for your react app.  Enzyme needs to be installed and the setupTests.js file needs to be created to use with your react app.</li>
        <li>You should do snapshot testing with just these two libraries</li>
        <li>You should test component lifecycle methods with jest mocks and enzyme like so:
            <code><pre>
                it('calls componentDidMount', () => {
                    jest.spyOn(App.prototype, 'componentDidMount')
                    const wrapper = shallow(&ltApp />)
                    expect(App.prototype.componentDidMount.mock.calls.length).toBe(1)
                })
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>You should test that props get passed correctly using jest and enzyme like so:
            <code><pre>
                //mock prop
                const user = {
                    name: 'John Doe',
                    email: 'johndoe@gmail.com',
                    username: 'johndoe',
                    image: null
                }

                //testing component called Profile with mock props
                describe ('&ltProfile />', () => {
                    it ('contains h4', () => {
                        const wrapper = mount(&ltProfile user={user} />)
                        const value = wrapper.find('h4').text()
                        expect(value).toEqual('John Doe')
                    })
                    it ('accepts user props', () => {
                        const wrapper = mount(&ltProfile user={user} />);
                        expect(wrapper.props().user).toEqual(user)
                    })
                })
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>You should test API calls using jest and enzyme.  You should mock the API calls for the test, by creating a <code>__mock__</code> folder inside your <code>__test__</code> folder which should be under <code>src</code> where you are saving your jest tests.  In the __mock__ folder you will have mocks like so:
        <code><pre>
            module.exports = {
                get: jest.fn(() => {
                    return Promise.resolve({
                        data: [
                            {
                                id: 1,
                                name: 'Jane Doe',
                                email: 'janedoe@gmail.com',
                                username: 'jdoe'
                            }
                        ]
                    })
                })
            }
        </pre></code></li>
        now in our test file for the component calling the API we can have:
        <code><pre>
            import axios from 'axios';

            //replace axios with a mock
            jest.mock('axios')

            it('fetches a list of users', () => {
                const getSpy = jest.spyOn(axios, 'get')
                const wrapper = shallow(
                    &ltApp />
                )
                expect(getSpy).toBeCalled()
            })
        </pre></code>
    </ul>

    <h2>Testing Redux Apps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For redux, it is recommended to follow an integration test approach instead of testing each unit.  If you do unit test, redux often uses pure functions (reducers, selectors) which are easy to test due to not having side effects, so you don't have to mock anything. </li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Action Creators/Thunks: </strong>For action creators, it is recommended to use createSlice, and createAsyncThunk, meaning the action creators will be automatically created and you don't need to test them individually. They are just implementation details and you shouldn't test them 99% of the time, the only time you would test them if for some reason you were exposing it to people so they could plug in their own middleware or something.  You can use jest-fetch-mock to mock up fetch requests that your Thunk action creators make, with this you don't have to change the thunk logic, instead their fetch request gets intercepted and a mock is used.</li>
            <li><strong>Selectors: </strong>Really not neccessary to unit test these.</li>
            <li><strong>Reducers: </strong>In most cases, reducers are implementation details that do not need to be tested individually.  If you have a particularly complex reducer, you could choose to test it.  To do this, you would want to test on the slice level.  So in your test file for the reducer, you would import a slice reducer, and the slice actions that you want to test.  In your test file, you can run the slice reducer with an action for the first argument, and a state for the second argument.  You would feed it an initial state that you manually define, and then assert that it returns a new state that you manually define as the expected new state.  You feed it the action, potentially with a payload that you manually define.  You can test it with <code>undefined</code> for the action and state of <code>{}</code> to test if it returns the initial state defined in the slice when it is run with an undefined action (i.e. what should happen when the reducer first runs)</li>
            <li><strong>Components: </strong>Most of the time you really don't need to test if actions are working in every possible edge case.  Just a handful of tests to make sure actions are dispatching correctly are what matter.  Consider components in redux get info from the store that should be displayed properly (so you want to test that)  and the component should dispatch actions possibly (so you want to test that it is dispatching actions correctly).  To test components that use redux methods, you should test at an integrated level, testing that the component behaves the way it should perhaps upon first rendering, and upon user interactions.  For instance you might have a component that first renders saying 'no user', so you write a test if that occurs, then when the user clicks a button, an action is dispatched that is asynchronous so now the component displays 'is loading', so you write a second test that this should occur, then finally the data comes back and a user name is displayed, so you write a third test to make sure that occurs.  The basic  sequence for testing components is create mock store/initial state, render the component, test the initial rendered output, perform a ui action, test that the correct redux action was dispatched.  You can use configureStore from redux-mock-store as shown below to set up a mock store to use in tests, it is called with an empty array outside the tests to return a mock store, and then before each test, you give the mock store the desired initial state. You can use renderer from react-test-renderer to render the component, and do so inside a real Provider component from react-redux, passing in your mock store.  It is useful to use snapshote testing for testing the initial state.  You can then also use renderer.act to perform ui actions like clicking buttons or filling out forms, then import the action you expect to be dispatched and check that it is dispatched with the correct payload. e.g. <code>
                <pre>
                    import React from 'react';
                    import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
                    import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';
                    import configureStore from 'redux-mock-store';
                    
                    import MyConnectedComponent from '.';
                    import { myAction } from './actions';

                    const mockStore = configureStore([]);

                    describe('My Connected React-Redux Component', () => {
                        let store;
                        let component;
                        
                        beforeEach(() => {
                            store = mockStore({
                                myState: 'sample text',
                            });
                        
                            store.dispatch = jest.fn();
                        
                            component = renderer.create(
                                &ltProvider store={store}>
                                    &ltMyConnectedComponent />
                                &lt/Provider>
                            );
                        });
                        
                        it('should render with given state from Redux store', () => {
                            expect(component.toJSON()).toMatchSnapshot();
                            });
    
                        it('should dispatch an action on button click', () => {
                            renderer.act(() => {
                                component.root.findByType('button').props.onClick();
                            });
                        
                            renderer.act(() => {
                                component.root.findByType('input').props.onChange({ target: { value: 'some other text' } });
                            });
                        
                            expect(store.dispatch).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
                            expect(store.dispatch).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
                                myAction({ payload: 'some other text' })
                            );
                        });
                    });
                </pre>
            </code> </li>
            <li><strong>Middleware: </strong>To test middleware, you need to mock the behavior of the dispatch call</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>File structure</strong> You might consider colocating redux tests next to the components they test, and separating different redux functionalities into different files, e.g. you might have a reducer defined in <code>src/store/topics/reducer.js</code>, and you could store tests for this reducer at <code>src/store/topics/__tests__/reducer.spec.js</code>, and even though selectors are defined in reducer.js, you might keep the selector tests in their own file at <code>src/store/topics/__tests__/selectors.spec.js</code>, and again even if actions (including thunks) are defined in reducer.js, you might have the action tests in their own file at <code>src/store/topics/__tests__/actions.spec.js</code></li>
        <li><strong>redux-testkit</strong> This is a library that can be installed in the root of your project with <code>npm install redux-testkit -D</code></li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reducer</strong> you can import this into your test file with <code>import { Reducer } from 'redux-testkit';</code>. It provides a nice syntax for testing reducers.  You would use it by first defining an initial state, then defining an action with a defined type property and perhaps a data payload that you manually define.  Then you want to provide this action to the reducer with the initial state, and test that it returns a state that you also define in the test as the expected new state.  The syntax is <code>Reducer(_myreducer_).withState(_initialState_).expect(_someaction_).toReturnState(_newexpectedstate_)</code> where the _variables_ are variables that you define in your it block before running this line last.  The withState() can be left out of the chain completely to simply use the initial state of the reducer as defined in the reducer's code. </li>
            <li><strong>Selector</strong> similarly you can import <code>import { Selector } from 'redux-testkit';</code> to test selectors in the same way as reducers more or less.  The syntax is <code>Selector(_myselector_).expect(_mystate_).toReturn(_expectedSelectorReturnValue_)</code> where the _variables_ are what you provide, and you feed the selector a current state, and test that it returns what you expect.</li>
            <li><strong>Thunk</strong> you can import this into your test file with <code>import { Thunk } from 'redux-testkit';</code> to help test Thunks action creators.  You use <code>const dispatches = await Thunk(__mythunk__).execute();</code> to execute the thunk, which runs the thunk and returns the action the thunk produces, (you have to set up a mock service for the thunk's api call). dispatches is an arry that you can access like dispatches[0] and do tests on its value.</li>
