        <h2>Basic Terms</h2>
        <p><strong>Functions: </strong>Functions are 'first-class objects' in javascript, they have properties and methods such as .length, .name, .toString(), can be assigned to variables and reassigned to new variables</p>
        <p><strong>function declaration: </strong>binds a function to an identifier, consists of function keyword, identifier, parameters and function body in {}</p>
        <p><strong>hoisting: </strong>can use a declared function before its been declared, not considered good practice</p>
        <p><strong>function call: </strong>running the code in the function body</p>
        <p><strong>parameters/arguments: </strong>parameters are part of declaration and treated like variables in the function, arguments are passed to the parameters when calling the function. If an argument is missing when called, then it will be passed in as <code>undefined</code></p>
        <p><strong>default: </strong>provide default param value by setting param equal to default in declaration, will use default if no argument is passed or if argument is undefined</p>
        <p><strong>pass-by-reference: </strong>if you provide a variable as an argument to a function, then the parameter references the same location in memory that the variable references</p>
        <p>if you reassign the parameter to a different value in the function body, then the new value is assigned it's own location in memory, and the parameter changes to reference the new location, leaving the original memory location and variable unchanged</p>
        <p>however if you mutate (change) the value at the original memory location, then the original variable will now also change since it still references the memory location that was mutated.  This only comes up with arrays and objects, that can mutate with methods like .push for arrays</p>
        <p><strong>return: </strong>execution of function stops once a return statement runs, undefined is returned if no return statement is included in function body</p>
        <p><strong>Helper function: </strong>any function that gets called inside another function's body</p>
        <p><strong>Function expression: </strong>defining a function inside an expression using function keyword, often anonymous, but can also be stored in a variable (convention to use const), not hoisted</p>
        <p><strong>Arrow functions: </strong>alternative syntax for function expressions</p>
        <p><strong>Concise arrow functions: </strong>more concise arrow function syntax in certain conditions</p>
        <p><strong>Anonymous function: </strong>a function expression or arrow function with no identifier, i.e. never assigned to a variable name (like defining a callback function directly in the call of the higher-order function)</p>
        <p><strong>Higher-order functions: </strong>Functions that accept other functions as arguments or return functions as output</p>
        <p><strong>Callback functions: </strong>Functions that get passed in as parameters and invoked in another function</p>
        <p><strong>Abstraction: </strong>The function name is an abstract (as in concise summary) of the function body, allowing for more readable and modular code</p>

        <h2>Functional Programming</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A paradigm that emphasizes immutability and pure functions.  Immutability means you don't mutate the provided arguments, and pure functions means there are no side-effects of the function and for a given input it always returns the same output.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Currying</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Currying is a functional programming technique to convert a function that takes multiple argument into a series of nested functions that each take a single argument.  This makes each function more single-purpose and thus easier to read, maintain, test, and debug.</li>
            <li>Currying is possible due to closure, which means if a function returns a function, then when you execute the returned function it will maintain its lexical scope.  Maintaining its lexical scope means the returned function's context will be the context it has in the written code, i.e. it will have access to variables in its outer scope as written in the code, and thus access to variables defined in the function that returned it.  This is true even though the outer function is done executing and off the stack.</li>
            <li>A simple example is: 
                <code><pre>
                    function curried_add(a) {
                        // has access to the argument for a
                        return function nested_add(b) {
                            // has access to the arguments for a and b
                            return a + b;
                        }
                    }
                    
                    // creates a local variable a and assigns it the value 1
                    let add_one = curried_add(1); 
                    
                    // add_one() still has access to the argument from curried_add()
                    add_one(10); 
                </pre></code>
            </li>
            <li>You can use arrow functions to make very concisely written curried function as so:
                <code><pre>
                    let curried_add = a => b => a + b;
                </pre></code>
            </li>
            <li>A more complex example you could use on an array of object that represent players in a sports league:
                <code><pre>
                    const setFilter = array => key => value => array.filter(x => x[key] === value);
                    const filterPlayers = setFilter(players);
                    const filterPlayersByCity = filterPlayers('city');
                    const filteredPlayersBySanFrancisco = filterPlayersByCity('San Francisco');
                    const filterPlayersBySport = filterPlayers('sport');
                    const filteredPlayersBySoccer = filterPlayersBySport('soccer');
                    
                    console.log(filteredPlayersBySanFrancisco); // Returns an array of players from San Francisco
                    console.log(filteredPlayersBySoccer); // Returns an array of players that play soccer
                </pre></code>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hoisting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hoisting is a process that occurs during the compilation phase of javascript code execution, which allocates memory to all variable declarations and function declarations and hoists them to the top of their scope.  It does the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Finds all of the variable and function declarations in the code</li>
                    <li>‘Raises’ the variable names and function declarations to the top of their scope before code execution (this includes raising nested function declarations inside a function to the top of that function)</li>
                    <li>Immediately initializes function declarations</li>
                    <li>Postpones handling initialization, or assignment of values, until the code is executed</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>This means function declarations can be called from anywhere within their scope, even if the declaration is written after it is called.</li>
            <li><code>var</code> variables are a little weird, they only get hoisted to the top of function blocks but not other blocks.  Also, when they are hoisted, they are initialized to undefined. Thus, if you try to reference the var in your code before you initialize it yourself, the var will be recognized (since it was hoisted) but its value will be undefined. e.g.
            <code><pre>
                console.log(myVarVariable);  //prints undefined
                var myVarVariable = 1;
            </pre></code></li>
            <li><code>let</code> and <code>const</code> variables are better behaved. They get hoisted to top of whatever scope they are in, not just function blocks.  Also, when they are hoisted, they are not initialized.  Thus, i fyou try to reference a let or const in your code before you initialize it yourself, although the name has been hoisted, since it hasn't been initialized it will return a reference error.  This is preferable to how var behaves because a reference error is easier to catch and debug than an undefined value. e.g.
            <code><pre>
                console.log(myLetVariable); 
                // triggers a ReferenceError
                let myLetVariable = 1;
            </pre></code></li>
            <li>The hoisting behavior for var, let, and const apply when they are assigned to a function expression as well, so be aware if you try to call your variables they will be undefined or throw a reference error if used before they are initialized in your code to a function expression.</li>
        </ul>
