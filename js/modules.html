        <h2>Modules</h2>
        <p><strong>Modularity: </strong>Software design technique where distinct parts each providing a single piece of the overall functionality come together to build a cohesive program, makes it more scalable, manageable, ability to incorporate libraries and frameworks</p>
        <p><strong>Module: </strong>A collection of code in a file, instead of a program being in a single file, it is organized into separate files and combined through requiring them where needed.  There are multiple implementations for modules with js (below) and which one to use generally depends on the runtime environment.  The Node environment prefers the module.exports/require syntax for importing and exporting modules, whereas the browser prefers the  ES6 import/export syntax for importing and exporting modules.  The node environment can support ES6, but doesn't by default.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Common JS (CJS)</strong>This is the syntax used by node, described in depth below.  Modules are imported synchronously and it gives you a copy of the imported item.  It does not work in the browser - it must be transpiled and bundled for that.  Allows you to import from a local directory e.g. <code>require('./myfile.js')</code> or a node module e.g <code>require('react')</code></li>
            <li><strong>Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)</strong>Uses the define method.  Modules are imported asynchronously.  Made for use in browsers</li>
            <li><strong>Universal Module Definition (UMD)</strong>Uses complex syntax using define and module.exports.  Works on both front and back end, often used as a fallback for bundlers like webpack in case ESM doesn't work</li>
            <li><strong>ES Modules (ESM)</strong>This is the format defined in ES6, works in most modern browsers.  Imports modules asynchronously and is tree-shakeable.  Generally considered the best due to simple syntax, async nature and tree-shakeability</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Exportable items: </strong>You can export top-level vars, lets, consts, functions and classes</p>
        <p><strong>File structure: </strong>a simple modular web project might have a file structure like</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
            index.html
            main.js
            modules/
            ├── module1.js
            ├── module2.js
            └── sub-module-group/
                ├── submodule1.js
                └── submodule2.js
            </code>
        </pre>
        
        <h2>Node Modules</h2>
        <p><code>module.exports() </code>used to export things from a .js file in Node</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>To export something from a file simply set module.exports equal to what you want to export, which is often an object, e.g. <code>module.exports = myObject;</code>, you can also do something like <code>module.exports.myFirstFunction = myFirstFunctionDef</code> followed by module.exports.mySecondFunction = mySecondFunctionDef, which creates the exports object one property at a time.</p></li>
            <li><p>JavaScript files run in the Node environment have a local module object with an exports property that holds everything in that file, aka module, available to be required into a different .js file</p></li>
            <li><p>This only works if running in Node, the module object and the require function are built into Node but not the browser</p></li>
        </ul> 
        <p><code>require() </code>used to import in node</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>To import something from another file with an export, create a variable to store the imported item and set it equal to require('myfile.js').  e.g. <code>myObject = require('./myFile.js')</code>, it can be useful to use object destructuring to get a particular property of the imported file, e.g. <code>{ myFirstFunction } = require('./myFile.js');</code> will just save the myFirstFunction property of the myFile.js to the myFirstFunction variable, instead of importing everything from the file.</p></li>
            <li><p>In node.js, require loads module at provided file path, .js extension of file path is optional and assumed if ommitted</p></li>
            <li><p>Node first checks if the argument provided is a core module of node, and if not then attempts to locate it at the path provided</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>ES6 Modules</h2>
        <p>The use of javascript on the web was fairly minimal at first and has grown a lot as the web 
            developed, creating the need for modules.  Modules were only introduced natively to the browser 
            runtime in 2015 with ES6 and has been adopted by most modern browsers.
        </p>
        <p>To use a js script that uses modules in the browser, when you import it into your html, you must include <code>type="module"</code> in the script tag.  You only need to link your html to the js file that imports other files (the top-level module), you don't need to link to the files it imports in your html.  Also, you don't need to include the defer attribute because module type scripts will be deferred automatically.  ES6 import and export can be used with js files served to the browser.  Note it won't work if you are viewing your website with file protocol in the browser due to CORS.  You must use a dev server and serve the whole folder with the js files.</p>
        <p>You may see .mjs as the file extension for modules (files using the ES6 import/export syntax) however this isn't generally recommended due to it being nonstandard and possibly confusing browsers and things</p>
        <p>ES6 offers named exoprts/imports, and export/import default.  For both types of imports, if the string at end of statement begins with a dot or slash, then it will be treated as a filepath
        otherwise it will try to import node core modules (no dot or slash), also if filename has no extension then js is assumed</p>
        <p>should not mix the two styles of named exports in one file, but can use both export default and one of the named export styles in same file, but best to only use one or the other unless for specific reasons e.g. if users of your module may only want to import a specific function (the default) but still need option to import other things (named exports)</p>

        <p><strong>Named Exports</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first method is to use a statement like <code>export { myVar as myAlias, myOtherVar as myOtherAlias }</code>, where the aliases are optional and you can export as many things as you want between commas.</li>
            <li>The second method is to export variables upon delaration, like <code>export function myFunction() {func definition}</code> or <code>export let myVar = 2;</code>, but no aliases are possible with this method</li>
            <li>Sometimes you may want to aggregate the exports of multiple sub modules into a single
                aggregator module.  The aggregator module doesn't do anything with the sub modules, it simply exports them all.  Then, a top-level module could import everything from the aggregator module, which makes things simpler in the top-level module because it can just import things
                from a single aggregator module file instead of having to import multiple things from separate sub module files.  In this case, the aggregator module doesn't need to import the 
                submodules and then export them, it can simply use <code>export { subModuleItem } from './submodules/subModule1.js'</code> for each submodule, with no import statement.  This will
                make the submodule exports available as exported items from the aggregator module.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Named Imports</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use <code>import { myAlias as myAliasAlias, myOtherAlias as myOtherAliasAlias } from './myFile.js'</code>, where the aliases are optional, but the names must match the names of the things exported from the other file (or their aliases if aliased).  </li>
            <li>Can use above to import just what you want, or use <code>import * as MyImportObject from './myFile.js'</code> to import everything and then you can access what was imported with
            MyImportObject.myAlias, MyImportObject.myOtherAlias, etc.  This will also contain the default export if there is one as MyImportObject.default</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Export Default</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can also use <code>export default myExportedObject;</code> to export a single item with ES6.
                (this is actually shorthand for a named export using a special default keyword: <code>export { myExportedObject as default }</code>) this can also be used inline upon
                declaration of a variable/function/class by preceding it with export default, but be careful with this because if it isn't a function or class declaration you'll be unable to reference the item within the module exporting it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Import Default</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>In conjunction with export default, use <code>import myImportedItem from './myFile.js'</code> (this is shorthand for a named import with the default keyword: <code>import { default as myImportedItem } from './myFile.js'</code>, where myImportedItem doesn't have to match the name of the item exported from myFile.js</li>
            <li>If you're importing an object, you cn't use destructing in the import statement, you have to import the whole object</li>
            <li>Can be used to import npm modules into js, after using npm install to install the package
            import lodash from 'lodash';
            or import specific functionality as in
            import throttle from 'lodash/throttle';</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Dynamic Imports</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can use import() as a function that returns a promise whose resolved value is an object containing all the exported items from a given module (both named and default exports). e.g.
            <code>import('./myModule.js').then(module => { do stuff with module.exportedItem1, module.exportedItem2, etc. })</code>.  This allows you to import module code only once it is needed, 
            maybe like only in the click event for a button for example.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Await export</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You may have a module that exports a variable that is a promise.  e.g a variable set equal
                to a fetch call on a server that returns a promise, which use .then to return json to the
                variable in a promise.  If you export that variable you can use export await or export default await when exporting it, so that when it is imported, it will wait for the promise to
                resolve before importing it.
            </li>
        </ul>
