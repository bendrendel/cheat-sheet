        <h1>APIs</h1>

        <h2>Basics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>API</strong> stands for Application Programming Interface</li>
            <li>Typically a layer of software on a server that handles operations on a database</li>
            <li>Provides specific rules to outside applications for how to interact with the data,
                like how to retrieve data that the outside application can then use</li>
            <li>Often data is returned as a JSON object, which you can manipulate to use in your application</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>API Services</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Free APIs: </strong>Some APIs like Yelp offer their API to the public to expand their reach because they make money
                the more their data gets viewed
            </li>
            <li><strong>Paid APIs: </strong>Paid APIs like twilio offer valuable services to programmers for a monthly fee or per use fee</li>
            <li><strong>Internal APIs: </strong>Developers will use APIs in their apps to allow for easy expansion, so different versions
                of their software (web, mobile, etc.) can easily use the API to interact with the data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>API Documentation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>APIs will provide documentation of how to utilize the API</li>
            <li><strong>API Key</strong> this is often require to be registered with the API
            to use it, it should be kept secret because malicious users could use it to rack up charges on paid APIs</li>
        </ul>
