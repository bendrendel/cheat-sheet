        <h2>ARRAY BASICS</h2>
        <p><strong>Array: </strong>a data type representing an ordered list of elements, 
            can contain all the same data type or different types</p>
        <p><strong>Element: </strong>each item in an array is called an element</p>
        <p><strong>Index: </strong>the numbered position of each element in an array, starts at 0 (zero-indexed)</p>
        <p><strong>Array Literal: </strong>Creates an array by wrapping items in square brackets, e.g. ['hi', 'me', 'yoyo']</p>
        <p><strong>Access/update elements: </strong>use index and bracket notation, 
            e.g myElement = myArray[2], or myArray[2] = 'hello there', returns undefined if index not in array</p>
        <p>chain together to access nested elements in a nested array, e.g. myNestedArray[2][1]</p>
        <p><strong>Nested Arrays: </strong>arrays that are elements in an array, e.g. [[1], [2, 3]]</p>
        
        <h2>BASIC ARRAY METHODS</h2>
        <p><strong>mutative/destructive method: </strong>changes value of array it is called on</p>
        <p><strong>accessor method: </strong>returns a new </p>
        <p><strong>.length: </strong>returns number of items in array, e.g. myArray.length returns 3 or 
            however many elements it has</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can set the .length property of an element equal to something to set the length of
                    the array, e.g. myArray.length = 4 will set the length of myArray to 4.  This will delete elements
                    if myArray's current length is greater than 4, or add empty elements if myArray's length
                    is less than 4
                </li>
            </ul>
        <p><strong>.push('element1', 'element2'): </strong>mutative, adds one or more elements (provided as arguments) 
            to end of array</p>
        <p><strong>.pop(): </strong>mutative, no arguments, removes last element of an array, 
            and returns that element (e.g. to store in a variable)</p>
        <p><strong>.shift(): </strong>mutative, no arguments, removes first element of an array, 
            and returns that element</p>
        <p><strong>.unshift('element1', 'element2'): </strong>mutative, adds one or more elements to the 
            beggining of the array</p>
        <p><strong>.slice(startIndex, endIndex): </strong>non mutative, returns a portion of an array 
            starting at startIndex and up to but not including endIndex, exclude end to go to end of array,
            exclude startIndex to start at beginning.  can be used to make a separate copy of an array as 
            in var newCopy = myArray.slice(); this avoids the newCopy variable pointing to the same memory
            location as myArray, but rather creates a new copy in memory</p>
        <p><strong>.splice(startIndex, deleteCount, replacementVal): </strong>Mutative, starting at and including
            the element at startIndex, removes deleteCount elements from the array and optionally replaces them 
            with an element with value replacementVal. Returns the deleted elements in an array.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Can include multiple replacementVal arguments to add multiple new elements</li>
                <li>DeleteCount can be 0 to delete no elements and this acts as an insertion of the
                    replacementVal elements, the first inserted element will have index startIndex</li>
            </ul>
        <p><strong>.indexOf('myelement'): </strong>returns the first index at which the provided 
            element can be found in the array</p>
        <p><strong>.includes('element'): </strong>returns true if the array contains the provided
            element, otherwise returns false</p>
        <p><strong>.sort(comparatorFunction)</strong>Returns the same array, but sorted according to the comparator function.  It is mutative, meaning it sorts the original array in place and doesn't return a copy.  The comparator function is optional and if left out, sort's default will be to treat each element in the array as a string and compare them lexically, sorting from A to Z.  This behaves as expected if you have an array of strings but, if you have an array of numbers like [10, 43, 5, 0, 4, 3, 2, 1, 11], it would return [0, 1, 10, 11, 2, 3, 4, 43, 5].  This treats the numbers like strings in determining the sort, but it doesn't return strings in the output, they are still numbers.  With the default comparator function, if the array is 10 elements or less then javascript will use insertion sort with runtime O(n^2) and space complexity O(1).  Otherwise it will use quicksort, with runtime O(n log n) and space complexity O(log n).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To use .sort with a custom comparator function, you should provide a function that takes two arguments, usually named a and b, and returns an integer.  a and b represent elements in the array to compare, and the return value determines how they will be ordered.  If the return value is negative then a comes before b, and if it is positive then b comes before a.  If it is zero then the elements have the same sort position and will not be moved.  The runtime and space complexity of sort will depend on the comparator function you provide.</li>
            <li>For instance to sort an array of numbers ascending, you could use <code>.sort((a, b) => (a - b))</code> or to sort in descending order you could use <code>.sort((a, b) => (b - a))</code>.  You could alternatively use the function below, which also works for strings since you can compare strings with greater than and less than for alphabetical ordering
            <code><pre>
                const ascendingOrder = (a, b) => {
                    if (a &lt b) {
                        return -1;
                    } else if (a > b) {
                        return 1;
                    } else {
                        return 0;
                    }
                };
            </pre></code></li>
            <li>To sort an array of strings by length from shortest to longest, and sort alphabetically if they are the same length, you could use the following (which calls the ascendingOrder function as defined above):
                <code><pre>
                    const sortByLength = (a, b) => {
                        if (a.length - b.length > 0) {
                            return 1;
                        } else if (a.length - b.length &lt 0) {
                            return -1;
                        } else {
                            return ascendingOrder(a, b);
                        }
                    };
                </pre></code>
            </li>
            <li>A more complex example creates a custom function that sorts an array, using the .sort method internally.  The idea is given an input array, and a separate order array, the input array will be sorted according to the order array, with any values not in the order array put at the end of the input array.  So, given an input array of ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'n', 'y', 'g'] and an order array of ['a', 'n', 'd', 'y'], the returned sorted array would be ['a', 'n', 'd', 'y', 'b', 'c', 'e', 'f', 'g'].  This could be implemented with:
                <code><pre>
                    const explicitSortWithComparator = (inputArray, order) => {
  
                        const explicitComparator = (a, b) => {
                            indexA = order.length;
                            indexB = order.length;

                            if (order.includes(a)) {
                                indexA = order.indexOf(a);
                            }
                            if (order.includes(b)) {
                                indexB = order.indexOf(b);
                            }

                            return indexA - indexB;
                        }
                        
                        return inputArray.sort(explicitComparator).slice();
                    }
                </pre></code> </li>
        </ul>


        <h2>ARRAY ITERATION METHODS (ITERATORS)</h2>
        <p>Special array methods that iterate through the array, passing each element to a callback function 
            that can be defined anonymously with function expression/arrow function, or you can pass a named function</p>
        <p><strong>.forEach(callback): </strong>Non mutative, Loops through each element of an array and executes 
            the callback function with the current element passed to it as an argument, return value of forEach 
            is always undefined</p>
        <p><strong>.map(callback): </strong>Non mutative, Returns a new array whose elements are the return 
            values of the callback function with the each element passed to it as an argument</p>
        <p><strong>.filter(callback): </strong>Non mutative, returns a new array whose elements are those 
            elements from the calling array that cause the callback function to return true when passed to 
            it as an argument</p>
        <p><strong>.find(callback): </strong>Returns the value of the first element in the calling array
            that cause the callback function to return true when passed to it as an argument, returns
            undefined if no element does this</p>
        <p><strong>.findIndex(callback): </strong>Returns the index of the first element in the calling array 
            that causes the callback function to return true when passed to it as an argument, returns -1 if 
            no element does this</p>
        <p><strong>.reduce(callback, initialVal): </strong>Returns a single value after iterating, callback takes 
            two args - an accumulator and currentValue.  On first iteration, the first element is passed as the accumulator, 
            and second element as the currentValue.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the callback iterates and whatever it returns is passed as the accumulator in the next iteration, 
                    with the third element now passed as the currentValue; the return value on the last iteration is 
                    returned by .reduce</li>
                <li>the initialVal parameter is optional, if included it is used as the initial value of the accumulator 
                    on the first iteration, and the first element of the array is passed as the currentValue</li>
                <li>There's also .reduceRight which works the same but goes from right to left</li>
            </ul>
