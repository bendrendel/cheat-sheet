        <h2>The event loop and concurrency</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>JS is single-threaded meaning it can only run one statement at a time.  This can result in blocking code, e.g. a long-running for loop blocks the stack while runnign preventing any other code from running.</li>
            <li>Concurrency means two or more procedures are executed at the same time by the same shared resource.  JS does not support concurrency, but it can emulate it through the event loop.</li>
            <li>The heap is a block of memory set aside for javascript where variables are stored in an unordered manner</li>
            <li>The stack is a stack data structure that keeps track of the current function running by adding a frame to the stack and connects its arguments with variables from the heap.  When you first initiate a js program, a global function is added to the bottom of the stack that doesn't go away until the program is over, it creates the global execution context that all other functions run within.  It contains the global variables and lexical environment.  Each frame added to the stack for a called function contains a function's execution context that includes the function's lexical and variable environment. So the stack is really keeping track of the current execution context with each frame.</li>
            <li>The event queue is a list of messages waiting to be added to the stack, which is added to by Node and Web APIS - this is what enables concurrency emulation</li>
            <li>The event loop adds the first waiting message in the event to the queue whenever the stack is empty</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Promises</h2>
        <p><strong>Promises: </strong>native in ES6, objects that represent the eventual outcome of an asynchronous operation, create from the Promise class, has one of three states, initially pending but guaranteed to settle. This is the modern replacement of callback functions, which should no longer be used unless necessary, in favor of using promises.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Pending: </strong>operation not yet complete</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Settled - Fulfilled: </strong>Operation completed successfully and promise has a resolved value</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Settled - Rejected: </strong>Operation has failed and promise has a reason for the failure</p></li>
            </ul>
        <p><strong>executor function: </strong>argument provided to Promise constructor, is called automatically when constructor is called, has two function parameters typically called resolve and reject</p>
        <p><strong>resolve function: </strong>first parameter of executor function, provided by the Promise constructor, accepts one argument that is the resolved value, when invoked it changes promise status to fulfilled and sets its resolved value to the argument passed to resolve() </p>
        <p><strong>reject function: </strong>second parameter of executor function, provided by the Promise constructor, accepts one argument that is the rejection reason, when invoked it changes promise status to rejected and set rejection reason to the argument passed to reject()</p>
        <p><strong>setTimeout: </strong>takes two arguments, first a callback function, and second a number that is the number of milliseconds to wait before adding callback function to event loop</p>
        <p><strong>.then(onFulfilled, onRejected): </strong>a method called on promise objects, takes two callback functions that run once the promise settles, the onFulfilled success handler runs if fulfilled, the onRejected failure handler runs if rejected,
            can use .then() with one, both or neither argument, .then always returns a promise with the same state and resolved value/rejection reason as the calling promise, unless the success or failure handler explicity includes a return statement
            typically they're made to return a new promise, if the handler returns a non-promise value, then a resolved promise is returned by .then with a resolved value of what was returned by the handler, if the handler throws an error, an reject promise is returned with the error message as the reject reason</p>

        <p><strong>.catch(onRejected): </strong>a method called on promise objects, works like .then but only takes one argument to run if the promise is in the rejected state, since .then returns a promise with same state as calling promise, you can use .then to handle success and .catch to handle failure.
        .catch returns a promise, this promise is in the reject state if an Error is thrown or a rejected 
        promise is returned, otherwise .catch will return a fulfilled promise.</p>
        <p><strong>promise composition: </strong>if only the onFulfilled argument of .then is used, and it returns a promise itself, then you can chain multiple .then calls, ending with a .catch to handle if any of the .then calls returns a rejected promise </p>
        <p><strong>promise.all([prom1, prom2, prom3, etc.]): </strong>takes an array of promises, if all promises are resolved, it returns a single resolved promise with a resolved value that is an array of the resolved values of each promise,     if any promise is rejected, it returns a single promise with a single rejection reason equal to the rejection reason of the rejected promise.  it "fails fast" as in as soon as one of the promises is rejected, promise.all immediately settles and returns a rejected promise</p>
        <p><strong>.finally(finalCode): </strong>a method that can be called on promise object, that runs
        when the promise is settled, regardless of it is fulfilled or rejected.  This is often used at the end of an entire promise chain, after the ending .catch of the chain.  It is useful for code you 
        want to run whether the promises are succesful or not.  e.g. it could contain a function that logs 
        out 'Operation complete', which would run after any success or failure handlers earlier in the chain.</p>
        <p><strong>Use cases: </strong>Most often promises are used when fetching data from a server, and
        you use a function like fetch() that returns a promise, and then handle the promise with .then and 
        .catch which themselves return promises with functions like resopnse.json(), reponse.blob(), etc.
        Another less common case is when dealing with an old-school syncronous database that you want to 
        be able to call asyncronously.  In this case, you create your own promise object with new Promise(), 
        and put the syncronous call to the database in this object, having it call resolve once complete, or reject if failed.  This will allow the syncronous call to run asyncronously so your stack isn't blocked.</p>
