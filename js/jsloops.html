        <h2>Loops</h2>
        <p>Repeat a set of instructions (iterate) until a specified condition (the stopping condition) is met</p>
        <p><strong>For Loop: </strong>When number of iterations is known in advance, Contains an iterator variable that is initialized, assigned a new value on each iteration, and checked against a stopping condition each time</p>
        <p><strong>While Loop: </strong>When number of iterations is not known in advance, iterator initialized outside loop, assigned a new value inside loop, checks against a stopping condition before running each iteration</p>
        <p><strong>Do...While Loop: </strong>Same as While loop, but stopping condition is checked after each iteration instead of before, thus it always runs at least once</p>
        <p><strong>break: </strong>A keyword that can be used in loops to end loop, good for testing conditions beside the stopping condition if needed to exit loop, helpful when looping through large data structures</p>
        <p><strong>Nested Loops: </strong>When a loop occurs inside another loop</p>
        <p><strong>Infinite Loop: </strong>To be avoided, when stopping condition is never met </p>
