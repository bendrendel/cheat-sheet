        <h2>Loops</h2>
        <p>Repeat a set of instructions (iterate) until a specified condition (the stopping condition) is met</p>
        <p><strong>For Loop: </strong>When number of iterations is known in advance, Contains an iterator variable that is initialized, assigned a new value on each iteration, and checked against a stopping condition each time</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Also can use for...of loops to iterate through arrays or strings and node lists (iterable    
                objects), using syntax of
                <code>for(const item of array) {do stuff with item}</code>, can use const let or var to
                declare iterated value.  Not good if you need access to the index of each item, should use
                normal for loop in that case, or also if needing to loop in reverse, or use the index to
                determine stopping condition or interact with a counter </li>
            <li>Can use for...in loop similarly but to iterate over keys of an object, like
                <code>for(let key in object) {do stuff with key}</code>
            </li>
            <li>Can use <code>break</code> in loop to end loop, or 
                <code>continue</code> to skip the rest of the code in the loop and go to the next iteration
                immediately.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>While Loop: </strong>When number of iterations is not known in advance, iterator initialized outside loop, assigned a new value inside loop, checks against a stopping condition before running each iteration</p>
        <p><strong>Do...While Loop: </strong>Same as While loop, but stopping condition is checked after each iteration instead of before, thus it always runs at least once</p>
        <p><strong>break: </strong>A keyword that can be used in loops to end loop, good for testing conditions beside the stopping condition if needed to exit loop, helpful when looping through large data structures</p>
        <p><strong>Nested Loops: </strong>When a loop occurs inside another loop</p>
        <p><strong>Infinite Loop: </strong>To be avoided, when stopping condition is never met </p>
