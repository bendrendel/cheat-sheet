    <h1>Webpack</h1>

    <h2>Installing Webpack</h2>
    <p>
      Install webpack in a project's root directory with
      <code>npm intall webpack webpack-cli --save-dev</code> which will install
      webpack and the webpack command line interface, and the --save-dev (or -D)
      to save to devDependencies in package.json
    </p>

    <h2>Webpack Config</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Add a file to the project's root directory called
      <code>webpack.config.js</code> to add configurations for webpack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The file should contain an exported object with the configuration
      settings, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        entry property with the relative path to the file to process/bundle,
        which is the entry point to the app
      </li>
      <li>
        output property should be an object with a filename and path property,
        controlling output when webpack is run, default filename is main.js,
        default path is dist created in the project's root directory.path must
        be an absolute path, thus you'll need to use the path node core module
        which generates the absolute path of the project. e.g.
        path.resolve(__dirname, app) will save the file named filename to
        ./app/filename.
      </li>
      <li>mode property webpack will use (development, production)</li>
      <li>
        watch property if true then when you run the webpack command (through a
        package.json script) it will stay running, and rebundle with every
        change to the entry file. press ^C to stop running.  However, if you
        are using the webpack devServer and it is set to hot, then you 
        should delete the watch property because the hot devServer will watch
        for changes automatically.
      </li>
      <li>
        module property can take an object with a rules property set to an
        array, this array can hold objects that each define how webpack should
        handle different filetypes. the objects have a test property set to a
        regex that matches the filetypes to handle, and a use property that is
        set to an array of package names that should handle that filetype. the
        example below has rules for using style-loader and css-loader, and also
        a more complex one for using postCSS-loader
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example Webpack Config</h3>
    <pre>
        <code>
        const path = require('path');

        const postCSSPlugins = [
            require('postcss-import'),
            require('postcss-mixins'),
            require('postcss-simple-vars'),
            require('postcss-nested'),
            require('autoprefixer')
        ]
            
        module.exports = {
            entry: './app/assets/scripts/App.js',
            output: {
                filename: 'bundled.js',
                path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'app')
            },
            devServer: {
              before: function (app, server) {
                server._watch('./app/**/*.html');
              },
              contentBase: path.join(__dirname, 'app'),
              hot: true,
              port: 3000,
              host: '0.0.0.0'
            },           
            mode: 'development',
            <s>watch: true,</s>
            module: {
                rules: [
                    {
                        test: /\.css$/i,
                        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader?url=false', {
                            loader: 'postcss-loader',
                            options: {
                                postcssOptions: {
                                    plugins: postCSSPlugins
                                }
                            }
                        }]
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Running Webpack</h2>
    <p>
      In your package.json file, add a script to run the 'webpack' command such
      as
      <code>"dev": "webpack"</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      run the script that runs webpack with e.g. npm run build to bundle the
      file in the entry property of the webpack config file to the output
      property of the config file. run it whenever to rebundle any changes to
      the entry file
    </p>
    <p>The output file can be linked to the index.html through a script tag</p>
    <p>If you are using the webpack dev server package, then instead of
      the webpack command, use webpack server, i.e. <code>"dev": "webpack serve"</code>
    </p>

    <h2>CSS Support</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      CSS Preprocessors like SASS LESS and Stylus, and post-processors like
      PostCSS allow you to write CSS files with special features like variables,
      nested selectors, and will auto-prefix properties that need a prefix like
      moz or webkit
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the box, webpack only bundles javascript. Additional npm packages
      are needed to support css and PostCSS
    </p>

    <h3>Supporting CSS</h3>
    <p>
      Add an import statement to the top of your 'entry' js file that imports
      the css file you want, e.g. <code>import '../styles/styles.css'</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Use <code>npm install css-loader style-loader --save-dev</code> to install
      the css-loader package and style-loader package and add it to the dev
      dependencies, these will respectively support importing the css to your
      entry js file, and applying the styles to your html
    </p>
    <p>
      In the webpack config file, ensure to add a module: rules array object
      that tests for css files and uses style-loader and css-loader (shown in
      the example config file above)
    </p>
    <p>
      instead of 'css-loader' in the config file, use 'css-loader?url=false' to
      prevent it from handling any immages referenced in the css
    </p>

    <h3>Supporting PostCSS</h3>
    <p>
      Make sure there's an import statement in your 'entry' js file as discussed
      above
    </p>
    <p>
      Now use npm to install <code>postcss-loader</code>, similarly to above
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll also want to use npm to install the features you want, e.g
      <code
        >npm install postcss-simple-vars postcss-nested autoprefixer
        postcss-import postcss-mixins --save-dev</code
      >
      to install variables, nested css, autoprefixing, imports, and mixins
    </p>
    <p>v  
      In the webpack config file add to the module rules array that tests for
      css files and use an object with a loader property and options property with the plugins listed (shown in example above).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        vars can be made by declaring e.g.<code>$bluecolor: #2f557s</code> in
        the css, and then can use that var name elsewhere in css, e.g.
        <code>color: $bluecolor</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>nested css can be written as in</p>
        <pre><code>
          .class { 
            .nested-class { 
              font-size: 1rem;

              @media (min-width: 530px) {
                font-size: 2rem;
              }
            }
          }
          </code></pre>
        <p>
          PostCSS will turn this into a single selector of
          <code>.class .nested-class {color: blue}</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use an ampersand in the nested selectors, to make css copy the
          top classes name for more control over the final selector and avoid
          multiple classes in the final selector. E.g.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          .block { 
            &__element { 
              color: blue
            } 
          }
          </code></pre>
        <p>Will turn into <code>.block__element {color: blue}</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        imports can be used by having a main css file and importing other css
        files to it, by putting <code>@import 'mymodule.css';</code> at top of
        main css file to import mymodule.css. @import is a native css feature,
        but using the postcss imports plugin will import all of the imported css
        code before going to the client, so that the client doesn't have to
        download multiple css files, which it would have to do using the native
        @import. css files to import may be named with an underscore prefix to
        indicate they are "partial files", e.g. _mymodule.css. can also import a
        node module package like normalize.css without having to specify exact
        path, e.g. @import "normalize.css" will know to find it in the node
        modules folder of the project
      </li>
      <li>
        mixins can be used by creating a _mixins.css file and defining mixins that can be used elsewhere thanks to importing them into your main style file.  mixins are essentially prewritten pieces of css code, e.g. 
        <pre><code>
        @define-mixin atSmall {
            @media (min-width: 530px) {
                @mixin-content;
            }
        }
        </code></pre>
        which can then be used in your css files, e.g.
        <pre><code>
        @mixin atSmall {
          font-size: 2.9rem
        }
        </code></pre>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Webpack Dev Server</h2>
    <p>
      Install in root of project with
      <code>npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev</code>
    </p>
    <p>In package.json set your webpack script to run 'webpack serve' instead
      of webpack (see details above in running webpack)
    </p>
    <p>In your entry js file, add the following logic that will allow the js
      to accept hot updates from the dev server:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      if (module.hot) {
        module.hot.accept();
      }
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Add a property to the webpack config file (see example above) called
      devServer, which is set to an object with the following properties.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>before is set to an anonymous function that will make the devServer
        reload the page everytime you make changes to index.html or other html
        files in your project.  without this property, the devServer is only
        watching for changes to the js file that it is bundling (which also
        watches for css changes since the css is imported into the js file)
      </li>
      <li>contentBase is set to the directory you want to serve, the directory
        that contains index.html
      </li>
      <li>
        hot set to true will make the server inject the new css and js to the
        browser upon change, not requiring a full reload of the page.
        if set to true, then you shouldn't use the watch property in the config object, because a hot devServer will automatically watch for changes, rebundle, and inject
      </li>
      <li>
        port set to e.g. 3000, set to 8080 by default.  the served page can be
        accessed at <code>localhost:3000</code> or whatever number you set
        the port to
      </li>
      <li>host can be set so that the page is served on your local network
        and can be accessed e.g. on your iphone if connected to the same network.  First find your local IP address (settings > network on mac) which starts with 192.168.X.X.  Instead of <code>localhost:3000</code> you can visit the page at <code>192.168.X.X:3000</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
