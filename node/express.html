    <h2>Web Application Frameworks</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Server-side frameworks, or web application frameworks are software frameworks that ease writing, maintaining, and scaling web applications. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>They ease working directly with HTTP requests and responses, and extract data from them, like the request type (GET, POST,etc), query parameters, body data, etc.</li>
            <li>They make it easy to define different routes, or mapping specific URLs to specific handlers to create the appropriate response</li>
            <li>They provide an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that is used for workign with a database. THis abstracts CRUD oeprations on the database, making data validation in the code easier, and decoupling the database from the web app, so the database could be replaced independently of the code.</li>
            <li>They provide templating features, to make it easy to insert data retrieved from a database into an html template, or a json template, xml template, etc.</li>            
        </ul>
        <li>Different frameworks have different effort to learn, some are best for certain purposes (e.g. Django was made with newspaper/blogs in mind), some are more opinionated (less flexible, but lead you in the right direction if you're solving a particular problem), some are lightweight and require you to use lots of other libraries where others are "batteries included" having lots of builtin functionality, some have better performance or horizontal scalability, some better support caching which may be needed as you scale, and some better support security</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Django/Python: This provides lots of built-in functionality (batteries included), is fast, secure and scalable, and promotes consistent good design practices, used by Instagram, Disqus</li>
            <li>Flask/Python: This is lightweight and good for small, resource-constrained systems like a Rasberry Pi</li>
            <li>Express/JS: Fast, unopinionated, and farely minimilastic, need to use other libraries, many major companies use it, like Uber, IBM</li>
            <li>Deno/JS: Simple, fast, aims to fill holes in Node.js to provide better security</li>
            <li>Rails/Ruby: Similar to Django, encouraging MVC and DRY coding practices, used on Shopify, Github, Airbnb, Hulu</li>
            <li>Laravel/PHP: Expressive and elegant, powerful enough for large applications</li>
            <li>ASP.NET: Built on common language runtime, meaning you can use any supported .NET language (C#, Visual Basic, etc.), can scale to huge applications, used by Microsoft, stack overflow</li>
            <li>Mojolicious/Perl: not much to say</li>
            <li>Spring Boot/Java: Easy to use, opinionated, stong at building large, cloud based apps, </li>
        </ul>

    </ul>
