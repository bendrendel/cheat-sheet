    <h2>Web Application Frameworks</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Server-side frameworks, or web application frameworks are software frameworks that ease writing, maintaining, and scaling web applications. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>They ease working directly with HTTP requests and responses, and extract data from them, like the request type (GET, POST,etc), query parameters, body data, etc.</li>
            <li>They make it easy to define different routes, or mapping specific URLs to specific handlers to create the appropriate response</li>
            <li>They provide an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that is used for workign with a database. THis abstracts CRUD oeprations on the database, making data validation in the code easier, and decoupling the database from the web app, so the database could be replaced independently of the code.</li>
            <li>They provide templating features, to make it easy to insert data retrieved from a database into an html template, or a json template, xml template, etc.</li>            
        </ul>
        <li>Different frameworks have different effort to learn, some are best for certain purposes (e.g. Django was made with newspaper/blogs in mind), some are more opinionated (meaning they force you to use it in a particular way which can make for quality fast code, but it will be focused in a particular domain or problem and comes at the cost of flexibility and general purpose nature of less opinonated frameworks), some are lightweight and require you to use lots of other libraries where others are "batteries included" having lots of builtin functionality, some have better performance or horizontal scalability, some better support caching which may be needed as you scale, and some better support security</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Django/Python: This provides lots of built-in functionality (batteries included), is fast, secure and scalable, and promotes consistent good design practices, used by Instagram, Disqus</li>
            <li>Flask/Python: This is lightweight and good for small, resource-constrained systems like a Rasberry Pi</li>
            <li>Express/JS: Fast, unopinionated, and farely minimilastic, need to use other libraries, many major companies use it, like Uber, IBM</li>
            <li>Deno/JS: Simple, fast, aims to fill holes in Node.js to provide better security</li>
            <li>Rails/Ruby: Similar to Django, encouraging MVC and DRY coding practices, used on Shopify, Github, Airbnb, Hulu</li>
            <li>Laravel/PHP: Expressive and elegant, powerful enough for large applications</li>
            <li>ASP.NET: Built on common language runtime, meaning you can use any supported .NET language (C#, Visual Basic, etc.), can scale to huge applications, used by Microsoft, stack overflow</li>
            <li>Mojolicious/Perl: not much to say</li>
            <li>Spring Boot/Java: Easy to use, opinionated, stong at building large, cloud based apps, </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Express Basics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Express is the most popular web framework for node, it is minimalistic and unopinionated.  This means there is no one right way to use it and it is used with lots of other libraries.</li>
        <li><strong>Built in features:</strong> Express itself allows you to handle different HTTP verbs, handle different paths, add settings like the port and location of templates, add middleware anywhere in the request handling pipeline, serve static files, and use templates to dynamically generate response.  All of this can be done with just Node.js but you'd have to write a lot on your own to accomplish it all.</li>
        <li><strong>Middleware:</strong> Being minimalistic, express is generally used with lots of third party libraries, which work as 'middleware', performing various functions in the middle of receiving a request and returning a response.  To use third-party middleware, you'll need to first install it in the root of the project with <code>npm install mymiddleware</code> and then require it into your express application.  Express actually provides one piece of middleware itself, which is static for serving static files like images, css, etc.  Middleware can be chained together and order may or may not be important, depending on if later middleware depends on the results of previous middleware, and is generally declared before routes are set so that the routes have access to the middleware.  You can also write your own middleware and will at least for error handling.  Middleware is used to work with cookies, sessions, user logins, URL parameters, POST data, security headers and much more</li>
        <li><code>Databases:</code> Express can work with any database mechanism supported by node, generally you'll install a node package driver for the database (e.g. mondodb, mysql, etc), and require it in to your express app.  The driver allows you to interact with a database.  You can alternatively use an ORM.</li>
        <li><code>Templates: </code>Template engines, called view engines in express allow you to define the structure of an output, and insert data, could be html but also other file types.  This would require the use of template engine.</li>
        <li><code>Directory Structure: </code>An express app could all be written in one file, but will often be split up accordign to function or domain (model, view or controller)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Express development environment includes an installation of Node.js, NPM Package Manager, and optionally the Express Application Generator.  Express is then installed as a dependency using NPM along with any other dependendencies like third party libraries that extend express.  Can run on any OS that runs node (Windows, MacOS, Linux).  Should always install the latest version of express.</li>
        <li>express can be installed in a project by first running <code>npm init</code> in the project's root folder, and then running <code>npm install express</code> to install to production dependencies. Now you can require in express in your js files and use it!  To run your app you can run <code>node my-app.js</code></li>
        <li>Alernatively you can use the express application generator to create an express app with a skeleton that follows MVC.  First install it globally with <code>npm install express-generator -g</code> (you may need to prefix it with sudo on mac and linux). Now you can navigate to the directory you want to create your project in, and run <code>express my-project-name</code> to create a project folder named my-project-name with express already installed.  Or with Node 8.2.0 or great you can run <code>npx express-generator my-project-name</code> which doesn't install it globally.  Now you need to go into your new project directory and run <code>npm install</code> to install all the dependencies that express-generator added to you new package.json file.  Now to run your app use <code>DEBUG=helloworld:* npm start</code>, as express-generator comes with a debugger tool. You can see your locally served app at <code>http://127.0.0.1:3000/</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Routes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Server</strong> Creating the most basic server is done by requiring in express, then using it to create an instance of an express application saved to the app variable.  This instance can be used to start a server and specify the server's behavior. The .listen method is called on the instance to start the server process, which will listen on a specified port for any requests and respond to them, and takes a second argument callback function that runs when the server starts.  You would save this in a file like app.js, and you can start the server by running <code>node app.js</code>
        <code><pre>
            // Import the express library here
            const express = require('express');
            // Instantiate the app here
            const app = express();

            const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4001;

            // Invoke the app's `.listen()` method below:
            app.listen(PORT, () => {
                console.log(`Server is listening on port ${PORT}`);
            });
        </pre></code></li>
        <li><code>app.use(express.static('public'));</code> can be used to serve up a static website in a specified directory 'public' in this case</li>
        <li><strong>Routes</strong> are registered on your express app to direct the server how to handle requests based on the request's path and http method. These path and method combinations define the endpoints at which requests can be made. The path is the part of a url after the hostname (or hostname and port number, e.g. with a local server the url localhost:4001/monsters has a path of /monsters). Different http methods have their own route making method in express, and these methods usually take two arguments: the path to match (a string), and a callback that handles the request/response and takes three arguments - the request received, the response to send, and next. When a request is received, express checks through your registered routes in the order they are written in your code.  It must match the path exactly or else it will move on (e.g. a request with path /monsters/23 will not match a route with '/monsters'). Once it matches a route based on the path and http method, it will run the callback for that route.  Unless next() is called, it will not continue looking to see if more routes match after the initial match. If no routes are registered that match a request sent to the server or if no response was sent by routes that were matched, then express will automatically send back a 404 NOT FOUND response.</li>
        <li><code>.send()</code> and <code>.json()</code> In the route's callback, these methods can be used on the response object passed into the callback.  These methods will send a response back to the client, and they take an argument of what should be sent in the body.  For instance, res.send(someObject) or res.json(someObject),  the <code>.json()</code> version just explicitly sends a json object and can be provided any javascript object/array as its argument, it will convert to json and send. You don't have to include anything as an argument and it will still send a response, for instance you may send an error code response back and not have anything for send's argument.</li>
        <li><strong>Route Parameters</strong> Routes paths can include parameters that are like wildcards in the matching process, which are given a name in the path to match and preceded by a colon, like <code>monsters/:id</code> contains a parameter called id.  Any request with a route such as <code>monsters/4</code> or <code>monsters/23</code> will be matched by this route.  Any parameters will be available in a object called params as a property of the request object passed to the route's callback.  Each parameter name will be a key and it's actual value will be a value. Note that numerical values for parameters will be returned as strings in the params object. e.g. 'monsters/2' would return an id parameter of '2' for 'monsters/:id' e.g. 
        <code><pre>
            const monsters = { 
                hydra: { height: 3, age: 4 }, 
                dragon: { height: 200, age: 350 } 
            };
            // GET /monsters/hydra
            app.get('/monsters/:name', (req, res, next) => {
                console.log(req.params)' // { name: 'hydra' }
                res.send(monsters[req.params.name]);
            });
        </pre></code></li>
        <li><strong>Query Strings</strong> Query strings in a request appearing after the path are not included in the path matching of routes.  Instead they are extracted from the request and placed in an object called query as a property of the request object passed to a route's callback.  Each query key becomes a key of the object and the query values become the corresponding values in the object. Note numerical values in the query string of the URL will turn into strings in the req.query object, e.g. ?id=2 will create a query object of {id: '2'} example: 
        <code><pre>
            const monsters = { '1': { name: 'cerberus', age: '4'  } };

            // PUT /monsters/1?name=chimera&age=1
            app.put('/monsters/:id', (req, res, next) => {
                const monsterUpdates = req.query;
                monsters[req.params.id] = monsterUpdates;
                res.send(monsters[req.params.id]);
            });
        </pre></code></li>
        <li><strong>String Patterns and Regular Expressions</strong> Special characters can be used in path strings as wildcards, and you can also use regular expressions.
        <ul>
            <li>A ? means the preceding character is optional, e.g. '/ab?cd' will match both '/abcd' and '/acd'</li>
            <li>A + means the preceding character can appear one or more times.  e.g. '/ab+cd' will match '/abcd', '/abbcd', '/abbbcd', etc.</li>
            <li>A * means zero or more characters can appear in its place.  e.g. '/ab*cd' will match '/abcd', '/abxcd', '/abRANDOMcd', '/ab123cd', etc.</li>
            <li>() can be used to group characters to use in combination with above, e.g. '/ab(cd)?e' will match '/abe' and '/abcde'</li>
            <li>You can also use regular expressions in place of a string route.  So, you would not have single quotes around it, but rather backslashes to indicate a regular expression.  e.g. a path of /a/ would match any path with an a in it.  a path of /.*fly$/ would match butterfly and dragonfly, but not butterflyman or dragonflyman.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><strong>Status Codes</strong> By default, .send() will use status code 200 OK for the response it sends.  You can specify the status code using the .status() method on the response object before chaining .send() to it.  .status takes a numerical argument for the status code. e.g.
        <code><pre>
            const monsterStoreInventory = { fenrirs: 4, banshees: 1, jerseyDevils: 4, krakens: 3 };
            app.get('/monsters-inventory/:name', (req, res, next) => {
                const monsterInventory = monsterStoreInventory[req.params.name];
                if (monsterInventory) {
                    res.send(monsterInventory);
                } else {
                    res.status(404).send('Monster not found');
                }
            });
        </pre></code></li>
        <li><code>.get()</code> is a method of an express application instance used to register GET routes. It takes a path for the first argument and a callback to run for the second.  The below would come after you instantiate app and define the PORT, but before you call app.listen().  The path may have a parameter if it is getting a specific resource by id or name, or it may not have a parameter if it is meant to return a whole collection of resources.  Best practice is to send back a 404 error code as shown above if the resource is not found and 200 (default) if found along with the resource.
        <code><pre>
            const monsters = [
                { type: 'werewolf' }, 
                { type: 'hydra' }, 
                { type: 'chupacabra' }
            ];
            app.get('/monsters', (req, res, next) => {
                res.send(monsters);
            });
        </pre></code></li>
        <li><code>.put()</code> This is used to match put requests, taking a string path as the first argument and a callback for the second argument with (request, response, next) parameters.  Put requests are used to update a resource and the path should generally contain a parameter because you will be matching the id or name of a specific resource to update.  Normally you should use res.send() to send back a copy of the updated resource with a 200 status code (default), and you should send back a 404 not found if the resource being asked to be updated is not found.</li>
        <li><code>.post()</code> This is used to match post requests that create new resources.  It takes a path as the first argument, and the normal callback with request, response, and next parameters.  The path will just be the path to some collection of resources that the client wants to add a resource to.  The information for the new resource could be contained in a query string, or it could come in the request body.  If the resource was succesfully created, then normally you should send back a 201 CREATED code along with a copy of the new resource.  If it wasn't successfully created, then normally you should send back a 400 status code.</li>
        <li><code>.delete()</code> This is used to match delete requests, again taking a path as the first argument and callback for the second argument with request, response and next parameters.  The path generally should contain a parameter for the id or name of the specific resource to be deleted.  If the resource is found and successfully deleted, you'll often want to send back a 204 NO CONTENT status, with no argument provided to .send().  If the resource being requested to be deleted can't be found it should usually send back a 404 status code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Routers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Routers are like mini express applications that provide all the route functionality but without starting their own server or listening on their own ports.  They are used to group routes that begin with the same path.  They are a method of the imported express library (as opposed to a method on the express app you've made).  They are "mounted" at a particular path to your main app using app.use().  The router itself can use all the same route methods as your app like .get, .put, .post, and .delete.</li>
        <li>Routers can be defined in the same file as app, but usually you will put each router in it's own file, export it, and import it into your app file. e.g.
            <code><pre>
                // monsters.js
                const express = require('express');
                const monstersRouter = express.Router();
                
                const monsters = {
                    '1': {
                        name: 'godzilla',
                        age: 250000000
                    },
                    '2': {
                        Name: 'manticore',
                        age: 21
                    }
                }
                
                monstersRouter.get('/:id', (req, res, next) => {
                    const monster = monsters[req.params.id];
                    if (monster) {
                        res.send(monster);
                    } else {
                        res.status(404).send();
                    }
                });
                
                module.exports = monstersRouter;

                // main.js
                const express = require('express');
                const app = express();
                const monstersRouter = require('./monsters.js');
                
                app.use('/monsters', monstersRouter);
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>To match the path of a request, the path will be matched against each app.use in app.js in the order they are written in your code.  Only the beginning of the request's path needs to match (e.g. both a request to '/monsters' and '/monsters/3' will be matched by a router to '/monsters'.  Once mathced, the request will be sent to the router, but only the remaining unmatched part of the path will be used to match routes in the router.  e.g. in the router '/' is used to match the request to '/monsters' and '/:id' will match a request to '/monsters/3'.  Routers can be nested and only the remaining unmatched segment of the path will be used to match within each nested router.</li>
    </ul>
