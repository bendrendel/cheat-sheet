    <h2>Middleware Basics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Part of the motivation for middleware is to improve code quality.  Quality code means code that is easier to read, update, and maintain because in general code will be read many more times than it is written.  A cornerstone of code quality is finding ways to not repeat code that does similar tasks, so that maintenance is reduced to a single section of code instead of many sections of similar code.  This is referred to as Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) or DRY code.</li>
