    <h2>Sieve of Eratosthenes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>An algorithm for finding all primes up to a certain number</li>
        <li>It starts by making a list of all integers from 2 up to the given number.  (2 is the smallest prime number so thats why we start there).  Starting with 2, you cross out all numbers in the list that are multiples of two (since they are divisible by 2 they are not prime).  Now you go to the next number in the list, 3, and eliminate all number that are multiples of three (since they are divisible by 3 they are not prime).  You continue this process until you get to the end of the list.  All numbers that remain </li>
        <li>A basic javascript implementation is:
            <code><pre>
                const sieveOfEratosthenes = (limit) => {
                    const testArray = new Array(limit + 1).fill(true);
                    testArray[0] = false;
                    testArray[1] = false;

                    for ( let i = 2; i &lt= limit; i++) {
                        if (testArray[i]) {
                            for ( let j = 2 * i; j &lt= limit; j = j + i) {
                                testArray[j] = false;
                            }
                        }
                    }

                    const trueIndices = [];

                    testArray.forEach((val, idx) => {
                        if (val) {
                            trueIndices.push(idx);
                        }
                    });

                    return trueIndices;
                }
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>This can be optimized in a few ways.  First, the inner loop can start at i^2, because all multiples of i less than i will have already been tested.  For instance when you get to 4, you have already all multiple of 2 and 3, so you don't need to test 2*4 or 3*4.  Second, with this in mind the outer loop can stop when i exceeds the square root of the limit, because with the first optimization in place, the first value tested is i^2 and as soon as i^2 exceeds the limit there will be no more possible values in the list to test.  Finally, you can eliminate all even numbers after 2 from the intial array since you know these won't be prime.</li>
        <li>With the optimizations, the runtime is O (n log (log n)).  n comes from creating the initial array (creating an element for each number up to n) and log(log n) comes from the iteration step</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Catching Rainwater</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Imagine a histogram, with multiple bars of different heights.  Image water filling the empty space above the histogram, but only as much as will not overflow the heights of the histogram bars, something like: </li>
        <img src="./histogram v2.svg" alt="">
        <li>The algorithm takes in the heights of the histogram bars as an array of heights (as shown on the horizontal axis), and returns an integer that adds together the height of water that can be held altogether by the histogram.  So the above diagram would give the algorithm an array of [4, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2] and return the value of 6.</li>
        <li>A naive approach would look like below, running in O(n^2) due to the nested loops</li>
        <li><code>
            <pre>
                function naiveSolution(heights) {
                    let totalWater = 0;
                    for (let i = 1; i &lt heights.length - 1; i++) {
                        let leftBound = 0;
                        let rightBound = 0;
                        // We only want to look at the elements to the left of i, which are the elements at the lower indices
                        for (let j = 0; j &lt= i; j++) { 
                            leftBound = Math.max(leftBound, heights[j]);
                        }
                        // Likewise, we only want the elements to the right of i, which are the elements at the higher indices
                        for (let j = i; j &lt heights.length; j++) {
                            rightBound = Math.max(rightBound, heights[j]);
                        }
                        totalWater += Math.min(leftBound, rightBound) - heights[i];
                    }
                    return totalWater;
                }
            </pre>
        </code></li>
        <li>A better solution with O(n) runtime and O(1) space complexity is below, it uses two pointers which is a good approach for many problems to avoid nested loops, it can solve the problem of finding two numbers in an array that add to a specified number, or reversing characters in a string 
            <code><pre>
            function efficientSolution(heights) {
                let totalWater = 0;
                let leftPointer = 0;
                let rightPointer = heights.length - 1;
                let leftBound = 0;
                let rightBound = 0;
                
                while (leftPointer &lt rightPointer) {
                    if (heights[leftPointer] &lt= heights[rightPointer]) {
                        leftBound = Math.max(heights[leftPointer], leftBound);
                        totalWater += leftBound - heights[leftPointer];
                        leftPointer++;
                    } else {
                        rightBound = Math.max(heights[rightPointer], rightBound);
                        totalWater += rightBound - heights[rightPointer];
                        rightPointer--;
                    }
                }
                return totalWater;
            }
            </pre></code>

    <h2>Knapsack Problem</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The problem is that you have a knapsack of limited weight capacity and a number of items you can fill it with that each have a given weight and value.  You want to maximize the value of the items placed in the knapsack while staying under the weight capacity.</li>
        <li>The recursive solution has O(2^n) runtime.  Starting from the last item, it goes through each item one at a time and decides the max value possible from either including it or excluding it.  If included, then the value will be the value of the item plus the max value possible from the remaining items within the remaining weight capacity.  If excluded, then the value will be the max value of the remaining items within the remaining weight capacity.
            <code><pre>
                const weightCap = 5;
                const weights = [1, 3, 5];
                const values = [250, 300, 500];

                const recursiveKnapsack = function (weightCap, weights, values, i) { //i starts with number of items
                    if (weightCap === 0 || i === 0) {
                        return 0;
                    } else if (weights[i - 1] > weightCap) {
                        return recursiveKnapsack(weightCap, weights, values, i - 1);
                    } else {
                        const includeItem = values[i - 1] + recursiveKnapsack(weightCap - weights[i - 1], weights, values, i - 1);
                        const excludeItem = recursiveKnapsack(weightCap, weights, values, i - 1);
                        return Math.max(includeItem, excludeItem);
                    }
                };

                recursiveKnapsack(weightCap, weights, values, 3);
            </pre></code>
        </li>
        <li>A better solution is the dynamic programming/memoization solution.  This has a runtime of O(numOfItems * weightCap). It creates a matrix of height equal to numItems + 1, and width equal to weightCap + 1.  The upper left corner of the matrix represents the maxValue possible if you have 0 items to choose from and a weight capacity of 0.  The bottom right corner represents the maxValue possible if you have numItems items to choose from and a weightCapacity of weightCap.  The algorithm starts by solving the upper left corner value, then the next value in that row (0 items to choos from and a weight capcity of 1), until it gets to the end of the row.  Then it goes to the next row (1 item to choose from, 0 weight capacity, 1 weight capacity, 2 weight capacity, etc), until it eventually solve the bottom right corner.  Each value can be found by using previous values solved for in the matrix, so things don't get recalculated and this is more efficient.
            <code><pre>
                const dynamicKnapsack = function(weightCap, weights, values) {
                    const numItem = weights.length;
                    const matrix = new Array(numItem + 1);
                    
                    for (let index = 0; index &lt= numItem; index++) {
                        matrix[index] = new Array(weightCap + 1);
                        for (let weight = 0; weight &lt= weightCap; weight++) {
                            if (index === 0 || weight === 0) {
                                matrix[index][weight] = 0;
                            } else if (weights[index - 1] &lt= weight) {
                                const includeItem = values[index - 1] + matrix[index - 1][weight - weights[index - 1]];
                                const excludeItem = matrix[index - 1][weight];
                                matrix[index][weight] = Math.max(includeItem, excludeItem);
                            } else {
                                matrix[index][weight] = matrix[index - 1][weight];
                            }
                        }
                    }

                    return matrix[numItem][weightCap]; 
                };
