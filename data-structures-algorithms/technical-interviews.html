    <h2>Problem Solving Approach</h2>
    <p>For every step, it should be collaborative and have lots of dialogue and communication for every part of every step.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Clarify the Problem: </strong>Rephrase the problem in your own words, and ask any clarifying questions you can think of.  This is an important skill in and of itself since software requirements are often ambiguous.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Create Inputs: </strong>Regardless of the code in between, define concrete inputs and outputs.  First consider the happy path: the inputs that would be the most common scenario and the output they would produce, and then consider edge cases, like input of the wrong data type. You might want to produce a variety of a few different inputs and their outputs, to help guide what your code should be able to handle.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Outline the Solution: </strong>Before writing more concrete code, break the problem up and outline the steps involved in the solution, without worrying about efficiency, just producing correct output.  This will guide writing your code.</li>
        <li><strong>4. Code the Solution: </strong>Now refer to your outline to write code for the solution</li>
        <li><strong>5. Test the Solution: </strong>Test your code with some test inputs and walk through the code one line at a time, writing down the value of any temporary variables and updating them if they change.  Fix any errors in the code that you catch.</li>
        <li><strong>6. Analyze the Solution: </strong>Figure out your code's time and space complexity in O notation.  If efficiencies are possible, implement them, or explain why efficiencies are not possible.</li>
    </ul>
