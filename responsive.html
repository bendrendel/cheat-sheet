        <p>Responsive Design is a website that resizes and reorganizes content based on the size of the screen 
            and size of other content</p>
    
        Relative measurements
        px: pixels are not relative

        em and rem should be used for text and any dimension related to text (padding around text etc)
        em: sized as a multiple of the font size of the parent element (whether defined or inherited from its parent).
            e.g. if font-size of parent is 18px, then 1.5em will be 27px.  good for sizing in comparison to nearby elements.
        rem: sized as multiple of the font size of the html element (root element, whether defined or using default
            browser font size for html element). good for consistent sizing across entire website.

        % for non-text HTML elements, often for box-model values like width, height, padding, border, and margins, and positioning properties top, bottom, left, right    
        %: for height and width sizes relative to corresponding parent dimension (which must be set),
            for padding and margin all sizes relative to width dimension of parent element

        /*
        Media Queries
        @media: media query ruleset keyword
        only screen: dictates what device type the rule set, it should always be only screen, outdated to use for print, handheld, etc
        media features: e.g. and (max-width: 480px), conditions that must be met for rule to apply, combine with and for AND logic, and commas for OR logic
        media query breakpoints should be set according to how the content for the page naturally breaks at 
        different screen sizes; they shouldn't be set trying to target different devices because devices vary so widely
