        <h1>Responsive Design</h1>
        <p>Responsive Design is a website that resizes and reorganizes content based on screen size, screen orientation, 
            platform considerations like if scripting is available, user settings like if they have a VPN the site
            shouldn't be blocked, and also the size of other content.</p>
        <p>It's not about a new design for every concievable device, but more like parameterized design, where
            inherent in the design is how it changes with different environment parameters</p>

        <h2>Relative measurements</h2>
        <h3>px</h3>
        <p>pixels are not relative</p>
        
        <br>

        <h3>em and rem</h3>
        <p>em and rem should be used for text and any dimension related to text (padding around text etc)</p>
        <p><strong>em: </strong>sized as a multiple of the font size of the parent element (whether defined or inherited from its parent).
            e.g. if font-size of parent is 18px, then 1.5em will be 27px.  good for sizing in comparison to nearby elements.</p>
        <p><strong>rem: </strong>sized as multiple of the font size of the html element (root element, whether defined or using default
            browser font size for html element). good for consistent sizing across entire website.</p>
        
        <br>

        <h3>%</h3>
        <p>% for non-text HTML elements, often for box-model values like width, height, padding, border, and margins, and 
            positioning properties top, bottom, left, right</p>
        <p><strong>%: </strong>for height and width sizes relative to corresponding parent dimension (which must be set),
            for padding and margin all sizes relative to width dimension of parent element</p>

        <h2>Media Queries</h2>
        <p>media query breakpoints should be set according to how the content for the page naturally breaks at 
            different screen sizes; they shouldn't be set trying to target different devices because devices vary so widely</p>
        <p><strong>@media: </strong>media query ruleset keyword</p>
        <p><strong>only screen: </strong>dictates what device type the rule set, it should always be only screen, outdated to 
            use for print, handheld, etc</p>
        <p><strong>media features: </strong>e.g. and (max-width: 480px), conditions that must be met for rule to apply,
            combine with and for AND logic, and commas for OR logic</p>
